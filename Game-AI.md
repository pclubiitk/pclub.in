# Game AI (Battleship)


‘Game AI’ was a ‘Summer Project’ under the Pclub with an aim to get familiar with python and pygame. So, the basic theme was to use the probabilistic approach to find the best move for computer for detecting the ships. It works on the principle of Monte Carlo Algorithm which is used to calculate probability.

The rules of game can be found on the following link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

## How to build the game from scratch:

  - First you have to get handy with python language.
So, you can refer “LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY “and solve the tasks. The link for it is, https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

  - After writing the few basic codes of python, start learning pygame which is an easy way to provide graphics to  your game.
The pyame tutorials are available in youtube videos of ‘Pygame game Development’

- Next, for the main algorithm you have to study the Monte Carlo Algorithm. You can follow this link to learn

## In this game:
- You can watch computer playing against itself on a randomly designed board.
- You can place the ships on the board for computer to try out to destroy in minimum shots.
- Computer will place the ship for you to find out and destroy them.
