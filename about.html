      Programming Club (or PClub) is a community of students highly enthusiastic about coding,
      ethical hacking, Web Designing and all other aspects of programming.
      We are a team currently of 3 coordinators (pre-final year) and 17 secretaries (sophomores).

      <br><br>
      Our Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pclubiitk">pclubtiitk</a> has grown to a massive size of
      18K members, who use it as a QnA forum, or to get information about activities and competitions happening in the world of Programming.

      <br><br>
      We organize activities related to Development (Web Development, Open Source, Game/App Development), programming contests, hackathons, Capture The Flag contests, et all.
      Lecture series are regularly taken on algorithms, web hijacking, development, among other things.

      <br><br>
      Apart from this, we also develop various applications to be used by the campus junta; like Puppy Love (during valentines week), organize activities like Linux
      Install fest, and promote Open Source.

      <br><br>
      During summers, we offer a large number of projects to the first year students through our Summer Camp. The 2016 Summer Camp saw close to 350 applicants.

      <br><br>
      Feel free to contact any of our members any time in case of any queries! We hang out on IRC at #pclub
      <br>
      <br>
      Happy Coding!
