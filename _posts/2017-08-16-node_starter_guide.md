## `console.log('Hello World')`

I assume that most of you are here to learn about Node.js. So, lets get started!!

## What is Node.js ?

**If you go by docs:** [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/). Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

In simple words Node.js is server side programming environment which helps us to create APIs which can be consumed by Mobile devices, Websites etc..

In 2009 Ryan Dahl released Node.js to run JavaScript on servers such as Linux and IIS Windows servers.

## Why should one learn Node.js ?

JavaScript is undoubtedly one of the most popular programming languages out there today, and for good reason. It can easily be run in your browser, on a server, on your desktop, or even on your phone as an app.

Before Node.js, JavaScript was only client side language meaning it can run only on browsers such as chrome, Mozilla etc.

You can find loads of stuff on the internet which will persuade you to learn Javascript and Node.js, but one reason which I find the most compelling is that you can pursue both frontend and backend development if you learn the above stated.

## How to get started ?

I assume that you know JavaScript but if you don't then you should probably first learn it, [this](http://www.amazon.in/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Morrison/dp/144934013X) is a very good book to start with.

First, Node.js is not a programming language but a minimal framework. Language is Javascript. And it is very easy to learn.

To begin with you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine(obviously), npm is installed along with it. There are a bunch of very good tutorials for Node.js available online. But I personally recommend to complete all the tutorials(exercises) of [learnyounode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/learnyounode), this might need a lot of googling and reading of [the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/). But if you are  not comfortable with the previously mentioned two thing(which you ideally should be if you want to become a good programmer) the go for [learn all the nodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQmX5gaHg2SXyKuT9BQ_nbFIdZ39yeRxH) lecture series.

## So lets get the whole thing started !
## Happy Coding !
