# Plugin: NERDTree

[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdTree) is another awesome plugin
by [scrooloose](https://github.com/scrooloose) which allows you to easily work on codebases having more than
one interlinked files, which you need to refer to all the time without having
to type each one of their names.

NERDTree adds a file browser to the side of your vim workspace as a window
from which files can be browsed, opened directly in place of the current file,
opened in a split window, opened in a new tab and more.

This is what it looks like:

Nerd Tree is very useful for web development projects which have files spread
over different directories. Its also very useful for a project involving many
files.

## Installation

For `vim-plug`, add the following to your .vimrc:

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
{% endhighlight %}

## Configuration

Go through the [README](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree/blob/master/README.markdown)
as well as `:help nerdtree` to learn everything there is to know about this plugin.

For a short intro and my personal settings, see below:

NERDTree is a plugin which I use rarely ( when working on proper projects with many files),
but when I do, I am very happy to have it.

The sidebar can be actually called using :

`:NERDTree` or `:NERDTreeToggle`

Both of these behave the same and toggle nerd tree. I have `NERDTreeToggle` mapped to a
special set of keys so that I don't have to type these commands again and again. In my
`.vimrc` :

{% highlight vim %}
" d for directory
nnoremap <leader><leader>d :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

This is my personal preference, but you can map it to whatever you want like : `<C-d>`
for `Control + d`. But before mapping it, you should ensure that the particular keystroke
is not already mapped to something. If it is, and you don't want that particular function,
or it is not mapped to anything then you can safely remap it. If it is mapped to something
and you need it, voila!! You have learnt something new and can now think about some other mapping.

Best way to check if something is already being used by vim or some other plugin, is to try it out
in the particular mode. For example, let's suppose you wanted to map `dd` to nerd tree toggle. When
you try it out in normal mode, you will see that it actually deletes a line. Now, I want this feature
for very fast deletion of lines so I won't remap it.

As a general rule of thumb, try not to remap the key combinations given in `vimtutor`.

#### Making sure that NERDTree is not the last remaining window open

In order to prevent nerd tree from sticking behind and preventing vim from closing once you have
completed editing, you should add the following line to your vimrc:

{% highlight vim %}
autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTree") && b:NERDTree.isTabTree()) | q | endif
{% endhighlight %}
