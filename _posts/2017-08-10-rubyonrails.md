## Hi reader !

Most of you would have learnt/seen HTML & CSS based static web pages.

Some of you would have also used Javascript to build dynamic web pages.

But when it comes to building web apps, you need to write/code server-side to bring life
to these web pages.

That's where [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) comes in.
For those of you who have had their hands on web frameworks would know there are
quite a few to choose from.

> Here's a [list of web frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks#A_few_good_web_frameworks) for your viewing pleasure.

And sometimes it's gets frustrating to choose which one to use. As it's unethical to force you
to select any of them.

Here's some good old praise for Ruby on Rails:
* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-startups-use-Ruby-on-Rails)
* [Pros and Cons of Ruby on Rails](https://bitzesty.com/2014/03/03/ruby-on-rails-what-it-is-and-why-we-use-it-for-web-applications)
* [A senior dev blog](https://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/after-two-decades-of-programming-i-use-rails)

### Tl;dr version of above posts

| Pros | Cons |
| Rapid development | Not as well known |
| Wide developer support | Some web hosts don't support it |
| Ruby is easy yet powerful|  |

## Getting started

Did I tell you how easy it was to learn Ruby on Rails from scratch ?

Have a look at [Rails book chapter 1](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning).
If you follow through the first chapter you would have already built a "Hello World" web app.
How's that for 'Rapid development' ?

Following the mentioned book would itself make you fluent with Ruby on Rails.

## Some advice on learning Ruby on Rails

* You don't need to be proficient in Ruby to learn Rails. [Rails book chapter 4](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/rails_flavored_ruby) covers most of ruby you'll need. A point to note is that rails in itself has lots of
functionality so it is better to use them instead of writing Ruby code for them.
* The chapter on MVC (Model View Controller) forms the basis of Rails web app so its recommended
to understand it well. More on [MVC](https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/).
* You also don't need to read the whole book to build web apps of your choice.
Chapter 1-6 is recommended, anything beyond that is your choice.

Some other tutorials to follow

* [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails)
* [http://railsforzombies.org](http://railsforzombies.org/)

So easy, right?

## Now get those web apps running !
