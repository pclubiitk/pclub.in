# Basics Of R

### Why Learn R ?
- Free, Open Source, Cross Platform Compatible
- No *Windows*, No Doors – R runs on all the platforms. Just name it and you got it!!
- R is a language evolved from the **Language** ***S*** (*created by Bell Technologies*)
- I bet plotting graphs could never have been easier
- It is the leading open source statistical and data analysis programming language,  as it handles and manipulates data too efficiently.

- I personally recommend you to use R on *UNIX* machines . I haven’t tried it on *Windows* yet :P
- Still not convinced ? [Here](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/07/a-big-list-of-the-things-r-can-do.html) is a list of things that R can do . Keep Counting !!

***Having Fun with R***
{%highlight R%}
install.packages("sudoku")
library(sudoku)
s <- readSudoku("c:/hard sudoku problem.txt")
solveSudoku(s)
{% endhighlight %}

Wondering what the above 4 lines of code can do ? Well It can solve the **hardest** *Soduku Puzzle* ever made ! Sounds Cool ?

Google ***"Making a word cloud in R"*** and see how easy it is !


Some Pre Requiste Knowledge
--------------------------

- How to start R ?
- Will their be an IDE where I can code ?

The installation instructions for various platforms (including Non *UNIX* products) can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html)

After Installation. Just open your terminal and type `R`

### **Some important things first**

- Whenever you are done with this language or simply wanna quit this Just type `q()`
- Whenever you are struck anywhere just type `help(commandname)`
- ***R*** is an expression language and is *case sensitive*
- "R" & "r" are two different things

- Whenever you type an expression, the value is **calculated , printed and lost**.
- You better save the results of your expressions in a variable
- An **assignment** also evaluates an expression and passes the value to a variable but the result is ***not automatically printed***

- Comments can be put anywhere starting with a Hashmark ( `#` )
- Commands are separated either by a ***semi-colon*** `;` or by a ***newline***
- If your command is incomplete R by default will give a `+` prompt and will continue to give a `+` prompt until your syntax is corrected.
- ***NaN*** stands for Not a Number


### ***Programming in R Finally***

After reading so much about ***R*** . It’s time to really start coding

#### Loading commands in R

If you already have a .R extension file with certain commands already written , you can load it with the following syntax

`source(“nameofthefile".R)`

Wanna store all the outputs for a particular session ?

`sink (“nameoffile”)`


Simliar to a *UNIX* terminal you can type `ls()` to view all the objects you created in ***R*** for a particular session.

>The collection of objects currently stored is called the ***workspace***

How to remove an object ?

Use `rm(objectname1,objectname2)`

**Removing all objects**

{% highlight R %}
rm(list=ls())
{% endhighlight %}

*Try to understand this command on your own.It's pretty easy*


#### Data Types

Used Python ? ***R*** might look familiar!

You can do mathematical operations like

`1+1` : Prints 2

Time to make vectors!

> `test` : name of the variable where the vector is stored
>
>  ` <-`  :  assignment operator (points in direction of the variable in which value is to be updated/stored)
>
>  `c()` : a function used to concatenate

{% highlight R %}
a <-"Hello World"
b <-c("Hello ","World")
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
Here you can see different ways to defining the same string.

`1:9` :   Creates sequence : **1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9**

`1.5:10` Creates sequence : **1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5**

`seq(intial,final,by,length)` : Function use to create sequence; we can provide increment values or number of values

`rep()`:  Function used for Replicating

**Examples**

|Code|Output |
|-------|-----------|
|```seq(1,5,by=1.5)``` |**1.0 2.5 4.0**|
|``` seq(1,5,length=9)```|**1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0**|
|``` rep(10,10)```| **10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10** |

<br>
**Try it yourself**

Try to understand the code snippet below, guess the output and then run on ***R*** and check
{% highlight R %}
temp <- 1:5
matrix(rep(temp,2), nrow = 2)
{% endhighlight %}



#### Operations on vector

You can do almost all possible arithemetic operations on a vector
Adding 2 vectors of same size, different size, multiplying, dividing, `log()`,`exp()`,`sin()`, `sum()`,`length()`,`var()`,`mean()`,`sort()`,`max()`,`min()`

>**pmin and pmax** :Returns parallel max and min of input values
>
>*Example*
>Run these commands and you will get a clear idea of pmin and pmax

{% highlight R %}
a <- c(10,3,7,9)
b <- c(9,4,6,4)
c -< c(9,6,8,6)
pmin(a,b,c)
pmax(a,b,c)
max(a,b,c)
min(a,b,c)
{% endhighlight %}

To intialize a vector with a value `numeric()` is used

```
a <- numeric(10)` : a has now value 10
```

**An Intersting Thing to Note**

Try the following commands

{% highlight R %}
test <- numeric()
test[10] <- 1
test
{% endhighlight %}

You should now see **NA's** in the vector

**NA** stands for Not Available

***NA*** : Missing values are represented by the symbol NA (not available)

How to check for **NA** in a vector ? : `is.na()`

**Example**
{% highlight R %}
test <- c(1,2,3,NA)
check <- is.na(test)
check
{% endhighlight %}

check will be **FALSE** for non NA values and **TRUE** for NA values

How to remove **NA** values ? Let's substitute NA with -1
``` test[is.na(test)] <- -1```


#### LOGICAL VECTORS ####
Can contain **TRUE** or **FALSE**.  What else ? **NA** : Don't forget this :P

Example: `test <- 5<6`


**Operations on Logical Vectors**

`!`: For Negation

`&` or `&&` : for *Logical AND*

`|` or `||` : for *LOGICAL OR*

#### Determining the type of a variable
`typeof(variablename)` : Return the type of variable
> Check out `mode()` and `class()` and read about the difference between the three

*We will discuss this in the next part :D*


##### Mathematical Basic Operations ####


| Syntax | Operation |
|--------|-----------|
|```sqrt(a)```|  Returns the square root of ***a*** |
|```exp(a)``` | Return the value of exponent of ***a*** |
|```log(a)``` | Returns the Logarithm base **e** of ***a*** Try ```log10()``` for base **10** |
|```var()```|Returns Variance of a vector which is passed as an argument |
|```sd()```|Returns	Standard Deviation of a vector which is passed as an argument|

<br>

> Note : Providing an input to a function outside it's domain will result in NaN ***Not a Number***


#### Strings ####

Also called ***Character Vectors*** follow **C** type escape character `\`

Combining Characters to Numbers !

`test <- paste(c("X,"Y"),1:10,sep="")`

`test`

The Output should look like ***"X1"  "Y2"  "X3"  "Y4"  "X5"  "Y6"  "X7"  "Y8"  "X9"  "Y10"***

>***paste()***
>
>Function takes an arbitrary number of arguments and concatenates them one by
one into character strings.
>
>The arguments are by default separated in the result by a single blank character, but this can be
changed by the named argument, `sep=`


***That's all for the Part 1 :D , We will be posting Part 2 soon***
** We will look into arrays, factors, table, matrix, data frames in the next part **
