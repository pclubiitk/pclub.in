# [Smart Mirror](http://11000011.github.io/Smart-Mirror/)

Smart Mirror is a project designed to get you ready for the day. It displays
the current weather, your schedule for the day, notifications from your mobile
and performs facial recognition so that the same software works for all users
using the mirror.

^ The above image will be superimposed over the reflection from mirror displaying only the bright portions.

* Weather is obtained using your current location
* Schedule is obtained from Google Calendar
* Notifications are mirrored from the user's mobile phone via PushBullet
* Facial Recognition ensures that notifications/schedule displayed are those of the person standing in front of the mirror

Received the **Best Applicative Project** during the Science & Technology Summer
Camp 2016.
