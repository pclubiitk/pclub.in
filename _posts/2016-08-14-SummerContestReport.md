# REPORT

This summer, Programming Club IIT Kanpur kicked off the 2016-17 season, with a Summer WPC held on the Hackerearth platform. The problem setter was [Arjun Sinha](http://codeforces.com/profile/ajs97), a student of the Y15 batch. There was an amazing amount of participation, both from within and outside the IITK campus. The contest was very well received by all those who participatd. Here are some of the contest stats:  

* Duration: 28<sup>th</sup> June, 2016 - 29<sup>th</sup> June, 2016.  
* Number of registered participants: 1301  
* Number of participants with atleast one submission:507
* Problem with most number of submissions: **Weird Chemists** :_464 correct submissions_
* Problem with the least number of submissions: **Tree Tank** :_10 correct submissions_

Now for the contest ranks-  
1. **Mohib Manva**, of DAIICT Gandhinagar  
2. **Satyaki Upadhyay**, of BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus  
3. **Swastik Sharma**, of IIT Kanpur  

The three winners solved all the 12 problems in the contest. Congratulations to winners!  

In conclusion, we at PClub were more than happy with the participation and peformance of the contestants. The problem gradient was good, with the easy problems being solved by a large fraction of contestants, along with submissions decreasing gradually on the medium and hard problems.
