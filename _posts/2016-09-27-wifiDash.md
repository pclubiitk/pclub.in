# [WIFI CAPTIVE PORTAL AND ADMINISTRATOR DASHBOARD](https://abhinavtripathi95.github.io/)

## Synopsis
The objective of the project was to create a system for authenticating users for free WiFi and a dashboard for the management of the same.
When the user connects to the WiFi network, the user is prompted to type in his/her mobile number. The system will generate an OTP and the OTP is sent to the user via SMS. Then the user prompted to enter the OTP, If the codes match, the user is then given limited access to the internet.
