We'll be describing the procedure of contibuting posts to the Programming Club website here.

The website is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and we use Markdown format for writing posts.
Here are some steps you should go through to contribute a post:

- Have a look at previous posts here at [our Github repository](https://github.com/pclubiitk/pclub.in/tree/master/_posts).

- Have a look at the following template for each post:
{% highlight markdown %}

Your article's content goes here in markdown syntax

{% endhighlight %}
Follow this template to the bit.

- Ensure that you are familiar with basic markdown syntax. It's really easy!

- Check that you have included credits, if any part belongs to someone else.

- Done already? Mail or message the markdown file to any of the coordinators, or at pclubiitk@gmail.com. If you're familiar with Git, you can also send us a Pull Request on our Github repository listed in the below point.

- [Contact Us](/contact.html) if there are any issues.

- And of course, we're open source. Find the source code at [Github here](https://github.com/pclubiitk/pclub.in), and feel free to open new issues, pull requests etc.
