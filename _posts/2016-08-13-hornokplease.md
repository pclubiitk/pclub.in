Our favorite truck driver Ramesh has become quite bored driving trucks.So to make his long tedious journey more enjoyable he decides to do the following mental activity - he chooses a number N , and finds the sum of all i such that   

1. 1 <= i <=N  
2. gcd(i,N) = i  

He then gives this sum to Suresh . If the sum is double the value of N Suresh says "YES" otherwise Suresh says "NO" . One morning Suresh doesn't turn up . So he gives Suresh's task to you . Given the value of N , print "YES" if the above sum is twice the value of N or "NO" if otherwise .   

**Input**    
The first line of the input contains a single integer T-denoting the number of test cases.    
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.    

**Output**    
For each test case print "YES" or "NO" according to the conditions stated above.    

**Constraints**    
1<=T<=1000    
1<=N<=10<sup>6</sup>
