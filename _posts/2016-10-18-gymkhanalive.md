^ This is a screenshot of the SNT council tab of Gymkhana L!VE

* This is a clientâ€“server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser.
* It runs directly on a mobile device, just as a conventional software application runs directly on a desktop computer, without a web browser. The interface is similar to that of Quora/Twitter/Play newstand.
* The webapp displays the latest news related to upcoming and on- going events with the highlights in the form of posts which can be expanded to view additional information. 
* It includes the name of the author and the date on which it was published. Further on expanding the post additional material including images and details are displayed.
* Every user can sign-up first with a valid email-id which is authenticated with a activation link. Users can then like, comment and even share on facebook.
* The homepage contains recent/top highlights. This page will also contain tabs for the various councils and senate. On clicking the posts are filtered out and the posts of the related council are displayed. 
* A search feature is also implemented. A person can search either on the home page or on a council specific page for the desired posts. 
* For each council on the left side-bar there is important information related to that council which includes the name and contact details of the various coordinators of the clubs of that council .

One of the successfully completed projects during the Science & Technology Summer
Camp 2016.
