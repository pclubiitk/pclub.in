# [Gymkhana L!VE](https://soumye.github.io/gymkhanalive/)

^ This is a screenshot of the SNT council tab of Gymkhana L!VE

* The web app is able to run on mobile devices like an app would. The interface is similar to that of Quora / Twitter/Play newstand.
* The website displays the latest news and upcoming and on- going events and highlights in the form of posts which can be expanded to view additional information. 
* Also the name of the author and the date on which it was published are posted. On expanding the post additional material including images and details are displayed.
* Also it has an option to like, comment and even share on facebook. For doing that one has to sign-up first with a valid email-id. To check that the email-id provided in the sign-up form is authentic, an email with an authentication link is sent to the given email-id.
* The homepage will contain recent/top highlights. This page will also contain tabs for the various councils and senate. On clicking the posts are filtered out and the posts of the related council are displayed. 
* We have also implemented a search feature for the posts. A person can search either on the home page or on a council specific page. 
* For each council on the left side-bar there is important information related to that council eg. the name and contact details of the various coordinators of the clubs of that council

One of the successfully completed projects during the Science & Technology Summer
