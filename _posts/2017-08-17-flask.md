### What is Flask?
Flask is a web application framework written in python. So now what is web framwork? Web Framework is a collection of libraries and modules that helps the developer to write applications without having to bother about the low-level details such as protocols etc.

### Why Flask?
Flask and Django are two of the most popular web frameworks for Python.
Both of them are awesome framework with their own perks and cons. 
Let's have a look on the basic differences between them and decide which one to use when.
Flask provides simplicity, flexibility and leaf to root control while Django provides an all-ready-for-you experience like you get an admin panel, database interfaces, an ORM, and directory structure for your apps.
So you should go with flask if you want a deep control on your database. Whereas Django is a blessing if you want to get straight-forward final product in a deadline on neck condition. :-p

### Prerequisite:
Python 2.6 or higher is usually required for the working of flask. So its recommended to have a hand on python before moving to flask. 

### Getting Started

Before we go to flask you might need to know about virtualenv. It is a virtual environment most of the flask developers use because of many reasons. One of them being the differences in python2 and python3.  So that when you are working with many apps then your installation for one component doesn't bring uncompatibility for others due to version differences etc.
To know more about it and setting it up follow [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/#virtualenv).

Now coming up to flask

#### Installing flask
```
pip install flask
```
After you have flask installed you are ready for your first app. Open vim (or any of your editor) and lets write the first hello world! application. Create a file hello.py and write the following code.

```
1 from flask import Flask
2 app = Flask(__name__)

3 @app.route("/")
4 def hello():
5  return "Hello, World!"
  
6 if __name__ == "__main__":
7   app.run()
```

Brief discription of what the code is all about.  
**Line 1**: Includes Flask in your python file  
**Line 3**: Initializes an app variable, using the __name__ attribute.  
**Line 5**: It is where the flask plays its role, it routes the traffic from a specific URL to the function directly below. Using different @app.route calls, we can 'trigger' different parts of the code when the user visits different parts of our application.  
**Line 7**: It returns a string ie. Hello,world! Here we can return a rendering template or HTML so that the user can see well formatted pages.  

**Line 10**: the run() method of the app we initialized in Line 3. This starts the development server for Flask and allows us to visit our web application from our local machine by visiting localhost.  

Now lets run our first app.  
Compile it using python compiler:
```
python hello.py
```
You will see something like this
```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the result of your hosted flask.

### Ending
So now you are ready to have a dive in the flask, and build your own applications, In the above app we just printed out Hello,world! we could have even renderd a whole of html page by using render_template, there are a lot of tutorials on flask available on the web, some of the references are:
