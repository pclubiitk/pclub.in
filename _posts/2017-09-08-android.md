## Starter Guide on Android Development

**GETTING STARTED WITH JAVA**

You need to know Java to be able to develop Android apps. If you aren&#39;t familiar with Java, go through any of the following links first, before moving on to courses on Android Development. If you are already familiar with Java, skip to Getting Started with Android Development.

**GETTING STARTED WITH ANDROID DEVELOPMENT**

Here are some links to courses available on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) which will help you get started with Android App Development.

[Android Layouts](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud834)

[Android Basics - User Input](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836)

[Android Basics - Multiscreen Apps](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839)

[Android Basics - Networking](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843)

[Android Basics - Data Storage](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845)

[Developing Android Apps](https://in.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851)

The above mentioned Udacity courses are elaborate providing intensive exercises along the way. They will also provide an insight into the practice of googling to accomplish tasks and reading the official Android documentation. Therefore, you may choose to start developing apps right after the third course, looking up the documentation or googling whenever the need arises for a feature you haven&#39;t learnt about.

Alternatively, you may go through the [official Android Tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html). [Vogella](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html) is also a nice place to learn Android Development.

You will also need an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (analogous to a workspace where you&#39;ll write and build code). A very commonly used IDE is Android Studio and you will need to install it (of course there are alternatives like Eclipse).   [This](https://in.udacity.com/course/how-to-install-android-studio--ud808/?) will help you do it.

**DESIGN PATTERNS**

There are different ways or design patterns according to which your code may be organized. Read the following blogs to know more:

**MORE FEATURES**

Here are some libraries used in Android development. You may find them useful as you continue with developing Android apps.

- [ButterKnife](https://medium.com/@pranaypatel/butterknife-a-viewbinding-library-for-android-beginner-guide-fd92caf8e505)
Helps in reducing repetitive boilerplate code (findViewById)
- Data Binding
Assigning variables to view attributes instead of hardcoded values is called Data binding.
