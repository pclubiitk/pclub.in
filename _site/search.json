      "content"  : "Have you ever wondered what happens when you type in a website on a web browser? And you must have observed that most websites end with .com, .in, .gov, .org, etc. What do these signify? To answer these questions, we need to understand the Domain Name System (or DNS). Let’s start with understanding how domain names are built.Domain HierarchyEvery domain, like google.com or medium.com, is built hierarchically. Let’s have a look at how it’s done.The Root Domain is an empty string, and the (.) is generally omitted while searching for a website on a browser. DNS doesn’t require this terminating (.), i.e., (google.com.) is the same as (google.com).TLD(Top Level Domain) is everything that follows the final dot of a domain name. For example, in the domain name ‘google.com,’ ‘.com’ is the TLD. Some common TLDs are Generic TLD(gTLD), Country-code TLD(ccTLD), etc.  Generic TLDs (gTLDs) comprise some common domain names seen on the web and refer to some purpose. For example, a .com is used for commercial purposes, .org for an organization, .edu for education, and .gov for the government.  Country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) are reserved for use by countries, sovereign states, and territories. Some examples are .in (India), .uk (United Kingdom), .au (Australia), and .jp (Japan).FUN FACT: Did you ever notice that many piracy sites have a ‘.to’ or ‘.hn’ or similar tags in their domain names? These are actually ccTLDs. These are the most suitable TLDs for those sites as countries like Tonga (.to) or Honduras (.hn) either do not have any policy against such sites or any dedicated personnel/body to take these sites down.Second-Level Domain is the part of a domain name or website address that comes before the TLD. For example, google in google.com is a second-level domain.A Subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain, using a period to separate it. For example- documents in documents.google.com is a subdomain.IP AddressesEvery device on the internet has its unique address, called an IP address. An IP address consists of 4 sets of digits (hence also called IPv4) ranging from 0–255(each set is formed by 8 bits), separated by a period(.), and is represented as 204.56.10.259.Every URL you visit on the internet is mapped to a similar IP address. In fact, the internet does not understand URLs like google.com or nwm.iitk.ac.in; what it understands are only IP addresses. Try putting https://202.3.77.93 in your URL bar and see where it takes you. Despite this, we all know that we are not expected to remember any IP address; then, who does this bookkeeping?Now, Let’s say you want to visit some website xyz.com that is hosted on some computer, and you don’t remember its IP address, but the Internet only understands IP addresses. Here, DNS comes to your rescue. The Domain Name System is a huge directory that keeps the records of every single domain name on the Internet and maps it with its IP address. Hence it acts as a translator and converts domain names into IP addresses so that the internet can understand them while increasing convenience for human users.DNS Query RouteBefore going ahead, let’s understand about nameservers. A nameserver is a server where DNS software is installed and works as a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses.When a DNS request is made, the computer first checks its local cache to see if it has the website already stored. Frequently visited websites are stored in the computer’s local caches to reduce loading times. Similarly, multiple such caches are maintained at different levels to reduce the loading time as much as possible. If not, a request to a Recursive DNS server (also known as a recursive resolver) is made (step 1), which is usually provided by your ISP(Internet Service Provider). The Recursive DNS server also has a set of cached websites where your website might be found. If not, an expansive search begins to find the website with the help of root servers (step 2), and they redirect the search to the respective TLD server (steps 3 and 4), which stores the location of the authoritative servers of all websites with a given TLD (steps 5 and 6). Authoritative servers contain the website in its original form, with all original files and records being stored there; any server containing a cached version of a webpage is called a non-authoritative server. The search finally reaches its conclusion at the authoritative server, and the query returns to your browser (steps 7 and 8).TRIVIA: Some of you must have noticed that sometimes when the webmail becomes unresponsive (primarily while accessing it from a ‘Jio’ network), changing your ISP helps you access it. Every time this happens, something is wrong with your ISP’s Recursive DNS server.ACTIVITY:You can view the local DNS cache stored in your computer by using the following commands:  Windows: Open your command prompt and enter the command “ipconfig /displaydns.”  Mac: Open the Terminal app, enter the command “sudo discoveryutil udnscachestats” or “sudo discoveryutil mdnscachestats” and input your password.  Linux: Unfortunately for Linux users, Linux does not store the DNS cache automatically.Proxy ServerSometimes requests sent to an authoritative server are intercepted by other servers containing a cache of the original website. The difference between this cache and the one on your device (local cache) is that these are operated and maintained by the owner of the authoritative server and functions to reduce stress on the authoritative server by redirecting less traffic towards it. This is called a transparent proxy server and is an example of a proxy server.A proxy server is an intermediary between a server providing a resource and a server that contains the resource and has a large number of applications in networking. Proxy servers are used from the user side to bypass firewalls and content restriction and on the server side to balance loads among many servers in a network, encrypt/decrypt data before processing, and to protect against OS-based attacks.ConclusionHence, each DNS request traverses large amounts of physical distances in its search for the IP address. The search can span multiple countries and continents while locating and reaching the root server, TLD server, and authoritative server before the correct IP address is located to bring back to your browser just in a span of milliseconds. So the next time you sit in front of your browser frustrated waiting for a website to load, remember this and be patient :P.References:https://tryhackme.com/room/dnsindetailhttps://kripeshadwani.com/domain-name-hosting-expain/https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-dns-hierarchyhttps://ipwithease.com/dns-proxy-detailed-explanation/https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-nameserver/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domainsExtra Readings:https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when (Credits: Naman Gupta)Authors: Geetika, Varun TokasEditor: Parinay Chauhan",

      "content"  : "  Linux Demystified is a blog series by Programming Club IIT Kanpur, covering all the major components of a Linux distribution. This series is not an introduction on how to install/use Linux, nor a comparison between various Linux distributions, rather an explainer on what makes Linux so customizable and powerful. At the end of this series one would be able to customize their own OS, appreciate the differences and pick from the options available at every small level of an Operating System.Although, a complete beginner would easily be able to go through all the blogs in this series, an amateur Linux user may better appreciate and relate to them.WHAT-da-F***X!Linus Torvalds (the creator of LINUX) had already considered the name Linux but found it egoistic. He initially wanted to call the OS FREAX (free + freak + ’X’ from Unix), even kept the name of the file as Freax for about a year.Here we will talk about the origins, versions, and predecessors of present-day Linux systems. Our story begins way back in 1969 with the development of UNIX.UNIX v0.0Unix began as a platform for the Space Travel game. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie’s (Yes, the creators of B and C) “Space Travel” implementation attracted notice. At first, the software had to be cross-compiled on a mainframe. The utility programs that they wrote to support hosting game development on the minicomputer itself became the core of Unix, The original spelling was “UNICS” (UNiplexed Information and Computing Service), which Ritchie later described as “a somewhat treacherous pun on Multics” that itself stood for MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service. The Unix tradition of lightweight development and informal methods also began at these roots. Multics had been a large project with thousands of pages of technical specifications written before the hardware arrived. The first running Unix code was brainstormed by three people and implemented by Ken Thompson in two days — on an obsolete machine designed to be a graphics terminal for a ‘real’ computer.When Unix was first written, most OS developers believed an OS must be written in an assembly language to function effectively and access hardware. Unix was ground-breaking because it was written in a language ( C ) that was not an assembly language. The C language operates at a level that is just high enough to be portable to various computer hardware. Many publicly available Unix software is distributed as C programs that must be compiled before use. Many Unix programs follow C’s syntax. Unix system calls are regarded as C functions.By the late 1970s, many universities/companies like the University of California, Microsoft Corporation started designing various variants of UNIX systems. It was developing into a “closed source” operating system.GNU/LinuxThe concept of GNU started on Thanksgiving of 1983.A post was released as “Free UNIX!” followed by“Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu’s Not Unix), and give it away free to everyone who can use it. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed […]” (The whole post can be referred to here.)The writer of the post went forward to write several components for the project GNU himself, including GCC (the popular C Compiler) and GMake (GNU Make, an Automator), EMacs (Text editor, developed earlier), GNU Debugger and commonly used shell utilities including awk, grep, ls and make.Till this point, all softwares had been made with commercialization implicit. A radical change is often perceived as crazy, and Stallman wasn’t the one who went without criticism.Stallman was thus deemed by many as a programming rebel that likens himself to the youthful idealist Che Guevara before 1954, wanting technology social justice without any accountability to anyone. Many would argue Stallman crossed the invisible line of future defiance at all cost when he opined when Steve Jobs died — “I’m not glad he’s dead, but I’m glad he’s gone.” A few years later, he began to openly encourage civil disobedience. Why Che Guevara Redux? Stallman is often accused of being an anarchist, which might not be accurate, but on the surface, it’s easy to relate to this analogy.Nevertheless, there is one obvious flaw in almost all of Stallman’s Public license demands; none of them have recourse or accountability.GNU thus was Richard Stallman’s concept that guaranteed end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify any GNU Licensed software. GNU is composed wholly of free software, most licensed under the GNU Project’s own General Public License (GPL), and is a recursive acronym for “GNU’s Not Unix!”.Stallman was looking forward to creating a Kernel for an Open Source Operating System, the work for GNU Hurd (the GNU kernel) was only in progress, but Linus came up first with his kernel which completed the missing piece in the GNU Project.Linux appeared to be Linus’ pet project at the start, more of a hobby, though one which required considerable skill. Linus built the entire Linux system from scratch. He wanted to build an open-source operating system too, for people to use, which at the time UNIX was not.As Linux grew, the GNU utilities began to be integrated with the Linux kernel. This resulted in what is called the GNU utilities-based OS, GNU software running on the Linux kernel. This model is followed by Linux distros today, which thus use a “GNU/Linux” system.  The famous copypasta —  I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux,” and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.BSDBSD stands for “Berkeley Software Distribution,” It was initially a set of modifications to Bell Unix created at the University of California, Berkeley. It eventually grew into a complete operating system, and now there are multiple different BSDs.Linux is just a kernel. Linux distributions have to bring together all the software required to create a complete Linux OS and combine it into a Linux distribution like Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, etc. In contrast, the BSDs are both a kernel and an operating system. For example, FreeBSD provides both the FreeBSD kernel and the FreeBSD operating system. It’s maintained as a single project.Linux uses the GNU General Public License or GPL. If you modify the Linux kernel and distribute it, you must release the source code for your modifications.The BSDs use the BSD license. If you modify the BSD kernel or distribution and distribute it, you don’t have to release the source code at all. You’re free to do whatever you like with the BSD code, and you’re not obligated to release the source code, although you can do so if you want. Both are open-source but in different ways.MacOS is a fork of BSD, which is why Apple is not obliged to release the source code.System VIn the 1980s and early-1990s, UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) were the two major versions of UNIX. In fact, for years after divestiture, the Unix community was preoccupied with the first phase of the Unix wars — an internal dispute, the rivalry between System V Unix and BSD Unix. The dispute had several levels, some technical and some cultural. The divide was roughly between longhairs and shorthairs; programmers and technical people tended to line up with Berkeley and BSD, more business-oriented types with AT&amp;amp;T and System V.Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC’s Ultrix received System V features. AT&amp;amp;T and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based SunOS to produce Solaris. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as POSIX and the success of Linux, the division between System V and BSD has become less critical.ConclusionAlthough there are multiple UNIX based Operating Systems, Linux is the most popular due to the sheer size of the community using and maintaining it. Henceforth we will only be focusing on Linux throughout this series.In the next blog we will talk about the steps involved during the boot of the Operating System. Stay tuned.Lastly, we welcome feedback, comments and suggestions.References:https://wiki.archlinux.org/https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch02s01.htmlhttps://groups.google.com/g/net.unix-wizards/c/8twfRPM79u0/m/1xlglzrWrU0Jhttps://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.htmlAuthors: Abhishek Shree, B Anshuman, Pratyush Gupta, Akhil AgrawalEditor: Naman GuptaDesign: Aditya Subramanian",

      "content"  : "Programming 101This would hopefully turn out to be a comprehensive guide to someone starting as a newbie in this vast world of programming. Here, we would like to give some personalized inputs on the generalized procedure of getting started. We will also assume that you all are well versed with using a computer.Note: If you have done programming before, you may wish to skip the first few sections.Text EditorsI am pretty sure, most of you must have had some experience using Notepad at some point in your life and would be thinking of using it for writing computer programs as well. While there is as such no big problem in using Notepad for writing the code, but soon it will make your life very hard. Here are some reasons why,  No Syntax Highlighting: Notepad doesn’t provide you with the feature of syntax highlighting and this is one of the biggest problems with vanilla Notepad. Visualizing reserved words with different colors helps a lot as you will end up making a lot fewer mistakes. It will save your life from getting miserable, debugging (removing logical and syntactical errors) your code the whole time.  No Autocomplete: Modern text editors come with the feature of autocomplete or if not, they have the functionality to install required plugins or extensions for the same. This feature allows you to autocomplete the variable names and reserved words. This will help in saving a lot of time and also making the code less erroneous.  No Formatting of code: Notepad lacks the functionality of auto indenting the code for you. Auto indenting makes the code more readable and easy to understand. It also helps in visualizing the flow of execution of the program. Lack of indentation will lead to making your code less readable and hence, debugging it highly difficult.I hope the above reasons were convincing enough to make you switch to a better text editor. We recommend using any one amongst Sublime Text or VS Code, or a dedicated IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for that language.We have written another blog on How to get Started with Sublime Text in Windows For Competitive Programming. Do read it for a practical walk-through.What everyone should know in today’s world.We provide a comprehensive list of to-dos. This list is not exhaustive; instead, it can be manipulated by the reader according to their interests and what they like among the below-mentioned points.Choosing your first programming languageAfter all the setup told above, it’s finally time to start coding! But wait, there are so many languages out there, which one to choose? We know that it might get confusing to choose a particular programming language, to begin with. There are various arguments in favor of different languages and we think a good first programming language should have the following characteristics:  It should be relevant today. The programming languages like BASIC or any of its sisters that you might have learned about in school are not much in usage today.  It should be easy to set up without much extensive work.  It should be simple to learn. (Note: We are not asking you to master it as it takes a lot of time to master a language.)That being said, these are our recommendations:C/C++— These languages form the basis of modern languages like Python and Julia. They carry immense speed and control over your operations too. Although that kind of control won’t be needed in our day-to-day tasks, we suggest one should learn either one of these to make a strong base for coding. The best resource we have ever obtained is IIT Kanpur’s ESC101A course material itself. It can be found here at Prof. Nisheeth’s website. It starts right from the fact assuming you don’t know anything about programming.Python — Python is like talking to a computer in a human’s language. It is much more human-readable than C/C++, which makes it the most popular language in the world. “Learn Python the Hard Way” by Zed Shaw provides one of the most comprehensive guides to Python. It will hardly take a few hours to complete the book, and we suggest you have Python 3.x.x installed (refer to this link for installation) and have the interpreter (refer to this link) running while you read the book so that you execute the code and experiment with the language as you learn.JavaScript — It is extremely relevant in today’s world, especially in the field of web development. Though JavaScript is a little slower than C/C++, JavaScript is indeed a very powerful language, and most of the modern websites are built using its frameworks. This is a pretty good resource to get started with this language.Bash — Bash is one of the most popular shell scripting languages. It is the default shell for most Linux distributions out there, and we programmers are addicted to Linux! If you don’t know what is Linux, it is an operating system used by all programmers. If you ever remember scenes from movies (The Matrix, how can one forget this) showing the person hacking a computer with lots-and-lots of green-colored text, don’t worry, you are going to get it all here in Linux! This may not be needed at the moment, but learning is always a plus-point, and who knows we may keep a super-cool session on exploring Bash scripting sometime in the future? This resource is a perfect place to start with.Competitive Programming — A Modern SportPrerequisites to understand this section: Some idea about what a computer program is, input, output, variables, etc.As you explore the world of coding, you see people who can come up with ideas quickly and type a piece of the script right away to solve a given puzzle or problem.This forms the core of competitive programming, where you are presented with computational puzzles. They are often presented as a small story having some context, where you are expected to code a program that can give the answer to the puzzle as quickly and as efficiently as possible. You would certainly like this domain if you get high solving puzzles!As all major companies all over the world need people with good problem-solving skills, competitive programming becomes a gym to sharpen your mind and showcase your skills on a global platform!Let us take a simple problem from Codeforces —See the above problem, for instance. There is a problem statement, and there is a prescribed input and output format. Your program must follow the specified formats. Try working out the problem for the sample input. Basically, for all possible input in the range given, your program should generate some output.Your program gets accepted when your output matches the output of the solution program written by the problem setter and tester! Note that your programs may be completely different, but if you have solved the problem correctly, the output must match!Obviously, you need to be able to write a program in some language. C/C++, Python, Java are popular choices, and you are taught C in ESC101.A good idea for a beginner is to learn the basics of a language and understand the fundamentals. As you gradually write more and more code, it becomes easier to transform your ideas into code, and the typing part becomes routine!When you put your logic or solution into code, you have implemented an algorithm. Sometimes, you use some data structures such as arrays, trees, set, map queue, etc. Don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with data structures — They are containers to store variables in some meaningful way so that you can retrieve them or their properties later efficiently. ESC101 will expose you to some basic data structures!As for algorithms, they are basically the steps to reach your goal. Suppose you want the biggest number from a list of numbers — You go through each number in the list and ask yourself if it is the biggest number you have seen till now? If so, remember it. And go on. In the end, you will have the biggest number on the list.Assuming your basics are good enough, to get started, you can create accounts on various online judges. Online judges are the websites that have problems and checkers, which will run your program on their servers. They have specially designed test cases to check whether your program gives the correct output!Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder, TopCoder, Hackerrank, etc. are popular online judges. You can join Codeforces where we have a CP group managed by PClub where interested students compete among themselves to be the Sport Programmer of the Month! We recommend that you regularly try to participate in contests organized by Codeforces and Codechef.There are a lot of good resources available online — https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming. This is a compilation of many popular free online resources with star ratings and all! Also, you need an efficient IDE setup to help you participate in contests. VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, PyCharm are popular IDEs that you can choose from. If you haven’t set up your IDE yet, you may want to check out our blog that gives a detailed overview of the procedure of setting up an IDE.Never be overwhelmed — There are a lot of things to learn in this wonderful journey! There is something called rating on Codeforces just like FIDE ratings of chess. To put things into perspective, the best of the best guys of the globe out there like tourist have a rating of about 3700. Our senior, Yash Chandnani (Y16), was leading from India until recently, at about a rating of 2700. They are all red coders! But hold on, there are only 9 red coders all over India at Codeforces at present!Cyb3r-53cur17y: Digital WarfareHopefully, you could read that… It is leetspeak for Cyber-Security. Maybe you have heard about hacking, encryption, WEP/WPA, cryptography, cipher, SHA, RSA among a lot of other things? Well, this is the domain of programming where the goal is to learn how to communicate securely and at the same time, learn about common loopholes that can be exploited by someone evil and should be mitigated.Do you see that padlock on the left of the address bar of your browser? Have you thought about what that stands for? Click on it —It says that the connection is secure and the certificate is valid. Now, what do you mean by secure?A “secure” communication channel between two parties A and B in the context of cybersecurity refers to three things as I understand:  The message from A reaches only B.  The message that B receives is only from A.  Only that message which A has sent is received by B — Message is not tampered with.This problem existed from that day when 2 cavemen wanted to communicate without their wives eavesdropping!When Julius Caesar wanted to communicate with his generals in a battle, he would shift each letter in his message by 3. “Send 5 legions to the north” became “Vhqg 5 ohjlrqv wr wkh qruwk”. Obviously, you understand nothing when you see it (unless you know the shift) and if you tamper with it, the “unshifted”(decoded) message will not be meaningful. So, it is somewhat secure.Some terminology in the example above — The original message is referred to as plaintext and shifted message is called ciphertext, and the shifting procedure is the encryption algorithm here, and the value 3 here is the key — it could have been any other number.With the advent of digital computing and availability of GHz processors, lots of manual computation can now be done in under a second. Suppose, you didn’t know that how much the message is shifted with, but, you know that the algorithm used to convert the message to a cipher is by some constant shift, you need to check just 25 possible cases, which is absolutely easy to check with the help of a computer (and manually too!). Checking every possible case is known as the brute-force technique in computer science.Nowadays, we are surrounded by a lot of devices, and we use them for a greater part of our day. Naturally, there is a lot of information that is being collected by apps and devices to deliver better service. But, we don’t want that information to be public or readily accessible by anyone! It can range from our private photos to our nation’s nuke codes!Cybersecurity can be broadly classified into two divisions — Theoretical and Practical. By theoretical, I mean cryptanalysis of encryption algorithms, where someone who completely knows and understands our algorithm, may recover the plaintext from the ciphertext without knowing the key. And by practical, I mean actually getting access to all the confidential information stored somewhere by exploiting loopholes in programs, source code and/or launching passive/offensive attacks.Come on, if your crush asks you for the name of your first teacher during a conversation, you are likely to not think anything about it. But, if you have set the answer to that as your security question somewhere? People can impersonate someone else on Facebook and other social media and gain sensitive information by such a social-engineering attack.Some websites may have expressed disapproval when creating a weak password — because such passwords are common and easily broken by dictionary-attacks!Now let me give some sources to learn further on the practical side:  https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/  https://ctf101.org/  https://picoctf.org/Honestly, it is not very easy to jump into the theoretical part — it involves a good amount of math. But, here are some links you can definitely explore —  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/index.htm — Must check out!  https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/cryptography-guide/  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptoA simple task for you: (Hint: learn how to use Google)— YjQ1MzY0XzE1X24wN183MHU2aF9sMzM3Xw==Web Development: Beginner’s RoadmapWeb development is the work involved in developing a web portal/ software for Internet users. Web-dev can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text(that’s how you kickstart things) to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.Now, keeping the intro part aside, talking about some real stuff.Web-dev has two subdivisions: Frontend and Backend. Frontend revolves around building the User Interface (UI) and everything you’ll see on different applications or software, and constructing the interface between the user and the machine.Backend development, intuitively, handles the ‘behind-the-scenes’ functionality of software applications. It is more about connecting the webpage to a database, manage user connections, and power the application itself.Let’s explore a bit about the two fields:Frontend Development: The most basic technologies you’ll need to have a grip on are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) will define the skeletal structure for your application. CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) describes the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. Finally, JavaScript adds the logic part to the application and is responsible for establishing connections between the frontend and backend (somewhat).To get started with things, you can refer to these amazing resources:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/LearnThis is a superb documentation by Mozilla and, in my view, the best resource to get started with web-dev. However, I feel MDN tutorials are of intermediate/advanced level.For a more basic approach, you can refer to the below two resources:  https://www.w3schools.com/html/  https://www.w3schools.com/css/After covering these subtle resources, maybe you could design your webpage and host it on IITK’s server (yes, you can do that too!).After learning these basics, move on to learn JavaScript frameworks like React JS (for web applications) and React Native(for mobile applications). The official documentation is quite extensive and is sufficient enough for learning these super popular technologies. You can simply follow the tutorials provided in the documentation and understand the workflow!Backend Development: Backend is much more involving in comparison to frontend. Some of the famous technologies in this field are Django( Python framework) and NodeJS( JavaScript framework). Obviously, for learning these frameworks, you need to have a good grip on Python and JavaScript, respectively. Now, backend comes in handy, mainly when you’re working on some web/mobile applications where you need to define specific functions that control things from backstage (google about “web API”).For learning Django, follow the tutorials on the official documentation, which would be good enough from the beginner’s perspective.For NodeJS, MDN docs are again pretty good! You can check them out here.Well, if you think things were that simple, you might want to have a look at the flowchart below. It might scare you but believe me, it’s really cool!_Where to test all this stuff you’ve learned?_Open Source! Honestly, contributing to open source organizations was my motivation for learning web-Dev. Almost every organization has a minimum of two projects running, which involves web development. You can choose your organizations and start to work on the relevant issues!Bonus steps: FOSSASIA runs its annual open-source fest Codeheat. There are various projects for you to work on with some newbie issues too, which I believe any beginner can start working on irrespective of their knowledge and experience in the field.Machine Learning — Does a machine really learn?When you hear about Machine Learning, all that strikes you is robots mimicking humans and virtual assistants getting closer and closer to humans every single moment. Well, these are certainly true, and innovation is occurring at a very rapid pace, but we shall start with the basics. One cannot jump to the top of the pyramid (does the top exist?) without climbing it step-by-step.Be Noted: To understand the following section, you need to have some understanding of Basic Linear Algebra and Python. It is okay if you don’t understand this stuff yet. You can always come back to this blog later when you have the pre-requisite knowledge!We shall first answer the main question in the first place — What is Machine Learning?Machine Learning is a branch of Computer Science that recently emerged, which helps humans in doing human tasks, the simplest of them being the identification of objects. The list is quite endless; modern-day Machine Learning models can predict, classify, and even generate new data.Machine Learning models are mathematical models. Research in this field has occurred for a long time. Linear Regression was performed by Gauss (1809) to predict planetary movement. The field requires high computational power since millions of mathematical calculations take place before giving a useful output. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), popularly known as Graphic cards emerged in the 21st century and were capable of handling calculations parallelly. This helped the field to prosper, and since then, there has been no stopping for groundbreaking research in ML.The first thing a beginner should learn in Machine Learning is a Linear Regression model. We suggest you learn the concepts as illustrated in the article. Now comes the implementation part.For this, you will need Numpy and Matplotlib. Numpy is a matrix handling library in Python. Matplotlib will help you plot your 2-dimensional data, and you can use this for visualization. A good tutorial for Numpy can be found here. One for Matplotlib can be found here. Let us proceed forward.Linear Regression data is available in plenty on the internet. If you are smart enough, you can make your own data (Hint:Use np.linspace, and introduce some randomness in the data). Use the ordinary least-squares loss function to optimize your model, and write a code for gradient descent which will minimize the least-squares loss function. Then create random data points (or linearly spaced data points :) ) and test how well your model has predicted using Matplotlib.Here is a bonus task for you. Try to figure out how this method of Linear Regression can be manipulated to solve for a polynomial of degree ’n’.Feel free to ask any doubts about any secretaries. You may also refer to various blogs explaining how to write your first linear regression code. Take it this way: you have been given a problem statement, and you have to solve it in whatever way you can. All the best!The links for the tutorials can be found here again —  Linear Regression Wiki — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression  NumPy tutorial — https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html  Matplotlib tutorial — https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-usage-py  A nice walkthrough Linear Regression — https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-regression-for-machine-learning/  A Python implementation of Linear Regression — https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-using-python-b136c91bf0a2This blog post is a part of the Programming Club, IIT Kanpur blog series.",

He recalled that during his time, IITK did not even feature in the list, while our sister IITs like KGP and Roorkee had 30+ selections. We have come a long way since then. Initiatives, that were started by the former coordinators years ago, and were continued in the subsequent years, have helped create a wonderful open source culture at IITK. In fact, besides GSoC, IITK students are starting to participate in other open source programmes (like Outreachy, Linux Foundation Mentorship Programme etc.) as well.In our tenure, we would certainly try to conduct more events that help people get started with open source development. In particular, we would try to help more first year students (if we have any) get selected. This time, we had only one Y19 UG selected for GSoC. It would be great to see many first year students in that list.Congratulations to all those who have been successful in their open source journey! All the best to those who’ll try in the future!

      "content"  : "IntroductionHello world!Welcome to the Programming Club Introductory Workshop 2019!SlackFirst of all, please join our slack at https://pclubiitk.slack.comand join the channel #y19 to receive future notifications regarding events and other stufffrom slack announcements directly.Life@IITKProgramming Club worked extremely hard this summer to design your life @ IITK. We’ve brought together the various factes that will span your wonderful journey through 4 years. You’ll find your personal academic schedule, can subscribe to Gymkhana events, gloat over your PORs, feel hungry with the mess menus of all halls, not get lost with the Map and plan your year with a customizable calendar.TerminalA vital skill for any wanna-be programmer.Try opening Terminal (sometimes known as Command Line) from the top-left menus. You should find it in the ‘System’ applications.All the computer systems running today run over a terminal. You can do everything possible on a graphical system using this terminal (except of course the things requiring visual manipulation).Some operating systems like Ubuntu might have a shortcut for this, you can open it using Ctrl+Alt+T, but not in the CC machines.This is where you should learn to do all stuff related to programming, since this gives you unfathomable power.Directory structureLinux organizes files and folders in the following way:  Files are kept inside folders  You can enter and exit folders just like in Windows`  Folders are named in the following way: /path-to-folder/folder-name. This is what completely describes a folder (or a file).  We will be using the word directory for folders. Please note this.To play around with this, try to use the following commands:$ ls# Lists contents of current folder$ cd Desktop# Move to the folder named Desktop$ cd ..# Go Back to previous folder$ cd ~# Go back to home folder(where you start on opening a terminal)$ touch try.txt# Create a new file named try.txt            Command      Full form      Description              ls      list screen      List all the files and folders in current directory              cd      change directory      Enter a folder whose path is known              pwd      present working directory      Full name of the current folder you are in              ~      tilde      Short form for your home folder              Ctrl+c(keyboard)             Exit/Cancel the current command              exit      Exit      Exit the terminal      VIMWe will be using vim to write programs. Open it from the applications menu. It’s very much like notepad from Windows.$ vim try.txt# Opens the file in vimType “An interesting programming activity”If you are currently in insert or append mode, press ‘ESC’ key.Press : (colon). The cursor should reappear at the lower left corner of the screen beside a colon prompt.Type wq! and press Enter key to save and exit$ cat try.txt# Displays the content of the file.Python InterpreterTry running python command in the terminal. You should see something like:Python 2.7.10 (default, Aug 12 2017, 22:05:31)[GCC 4.9.3] on linux2Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is the place where you type. Try typing some of thecommands like:  2+2  print “hello world!”PythonHere are a few python expressions:  a = 2+2  print &quot;hello world!&quot;  print a  print a*2Try typing the above lines in vim and then saving the file astest.py.After saving the file, you will need to navigate to its locationfrom the terminal. Once you are in the folder containing test.py suchthat ls shows test.py as one of the files, run:$ python test.pyThe output would be something like this:hello world!48You used an operator in a*2 - the multiplication operator. Other operators you need to try out are:            +      Addition              -      Subtraction              *      Multiplication              /      Division              **      To the power of      If/ElseNow that you know how to write simple things, let’s proceed to something interesting.Python reads spaces and tabs in your program as well. So for writing a complicatedinstruction for the computer, we will need to use multiple lines.We will indent the lines in such a way that the computer can understand thatthey are meant to be read together.Try the following:a = 0if a is not 0:    print &quot;a is not zero&quot;else:    print &quot;a is zero&quot;That’s it! See?Sometimes one condition isn’t enough though. In that case, you are allowed to chain up multiple conditions using and and or like so:a = 0b = 0if a is 1 or b is a:print &quot;Condition successful&quot;else:print &quot;condition failed&quot;That’s all good, but what if you want multiple checks on a variable? For example, let’s say you want to do Action 1 if a&amp;lt;10 and Action 2 if a=10 and Action 3 when a&amp;gt;10, what then? This is where if-elif-elif-elif-...-else construct comes into the picture. Use it like this:a = 4if a &amp;lt; 0:print &quot;a is less than 0&quot;elif a &amp;gt;= 0 and a &amp;lt; 4:print &quot;a is between 0 and 4&quot;elif a &amp;gt;= 4 and a &amp;lt; 10:print &quot;a is between 4 and 10&quot;else:print &quot;a is bigger than 10&quot;LoopsNow for some loopy-loops!a = 0while a &amp;lt; 10:    print a    a = a + 1ArraysNow for some adorable arrays!a=[]for i in range(0,10):a[i]=int(raw_input)print(a)FunctionsAdding modularity to your codedef max(a,b,c):if a/b&amp;gt;1:a,b=b,aif b/c&amp;gt;1:b,c=c,bif a/c&amp;gt;1:a,c=c,aprint(a)print(max(3,2,5))print(max(0,0,0))Reading inputYou can read input from the user using something like this:a = raw_input()print &quot;Hello mr. &quot; + ab = int(raw_input())print b + 5See what happens there?CodeChef!Try this link hereCan you solve this problem?

      "content"  : "What are GANs?Unlike previous deep learning fields which focus on classifying things, generative models try to produce things. Classifying an image as drawn by Monet or as a fake is easy, but creating a drawing in the Monet style is quite challenging. GANs are the solution to this challenge. Cool, isn’t it?Generator And DiscriminatorGANs try to achieve what they promise to do by using an adverserial process of training two networks simultaneously ,the Generator network which tries to capture the data distribution by producing stuff from absolute noise, and the Discrimnator network which tries to tell the probability that the data point came from the original distribution compared to the generator network. This turns out to be a MiniMax two player game.Adverserial NetsBoth the networks are multilayer perceptrons. G(z;θg) is a differentiable function such that z is sampled from random noise and  θg are the parameters we wish to learn. D(x;θd) is the second network that takes x either from the generator netowrk or the original distribution and predicts the probability of its coming from the latter to its former.D is trained so as to maximise the assigning of correct labels to data from original distribution and that from G. Simultaneously G is trained to fool D.Mathematically , the attempt is tominimize log(1 – D(G(z))).Essentially it boils down to a two player MiniMax Game with value function V(G,D).minGmaxDV(D,G) =Ex∼pdata(x)[logD(x)] +Ez∼pz(z)[log(1−D(G(z)))]The Training ProcessThe following Algorithm is generally followed to train the network.

Update the discriminator by ascending its stochastic gradient.∇θd1mm∑i=1[logD(x(i))+ log(1−D(G(z(i))))]  Sample a minibatch of m samples from the noise distribution.

      "content"  : "Data encryption standard is a symmetric-key block cipher published by National Institute of Standard and Technology(NIST).Symmetric-key block cipherLet us first understand what this means.Every encryption algorithm uses a key to encrypt data and decrypt it. Since the key used for encryption and decryption is same in DES it is a symmetric-key cipher. It encrypts a 64-bit block at once so it is also a block cipher. Hence the name “symmetric-key block cipher”.Now we are ready to dive into what happens to the data in DES:The input data is passed through 16 similar rounds where the input is broken into two blocks(32-bits each) and the right block is passed through an encrypting function which gives 32-bit output. This output is then xor’ed with left block and the blocks obtained serve as input to the next round. Each round has a different 48-bit key which is generated from a 64-bit key using key-scheduling function.Step1: Initial PermutationThe 64-bits input first goes through a standard permutation which is known publicly. It is available on the internet.After this permutation, the rest of the steps are common to all 16 rounds.Step2: Expansion of inputThe permuted input is now broken into two blocks of 32-bits each. The right block is always input of the encrypting function while the left block remains unchanged. So we have this 32-bits input and a 48-bits key. The first thing we do is expand the 32-bits input to 48 bits.Step3: XOR input with keyThe right block of input which was expanded to 48-bits is now xor’ed with the key. XOR means bit by bit addition modulo 2.Step3:S BoxesThis step makes use of S boxes which are non-linear mappings from 6-bits input to a 4-bits output.The xor’ed value (48 bit) from the previous step is divided into 8 blocks of 6-bits. The first block is fed to S1, second to S2 and so on. Each S box now maps the 6-bit entry to a 4-bit output, so the output of all S boxes form a 32-bits output.The inner configurations of S boxes is also available on the internet.Step4: Permutation again!The output of S boxes, forming 32-bits, is again permuted to give 32-bits block according to another standard permutation table.The encrypting functionStep5: XOR with left blockThe final output obtained from the previous step is now xor’ed with the left block. This xor’ed value now serves as the right block for next round and the left block will be the right block of the previous round before operating the encrypting function.Ln = Rn-1Rn = Ln-1  xor f(Kn-1, Rn-1)Step6: Last PermutationAfter last round, the bits are permuted for one last time. This permutation is the opposite of initial permutation. It is chosen this way to make DES completely symmetric so that nothing new has to be done to decrypt ciphered data.DecryptionDecryption in DES is very easy. Since it is a symmetric cipher, all we need to do is put the encrypted text as input and use keys in opposite order. The output you will get will be the plain text.Security  DES was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.  It is no more a secure standard.  Due to small length of key(56-bits), key can be found using brute force method.  Differential cryptanalysis can also reduce the area of search for the possible key.  In July 2017, a chosen-plaintext attack utilizing a rainbow table can recover the DES key for a single specific chosen plaintext 1122334455667788 in 25 seconds. A new rainbow table has to be calculated per plaintext.",

      "content"  : "IntroductionNeural networks , especially convolutional neural networks, have a lot to offer than classification tasks and its optimization. Variational autoencoders are an example of a use case of CNN lets you generate new images by learning the probability distribution of the images of the input dataset . Although they are currently inferior to the state of the art networks for similar usecase, i.e GANs ,  a fully probabilistic approach for Variational autoencoders make them quite interesting to explore.Prerequisites  Elementary knowledge about probability distributions and convolutional neural networks  Desire to learn about generative networksLet us begin. We’ll start with a deep dive into pros and cons of autoencoders and KL divergence .AutoencodersAn autoencoder network is a pair of two connected networks- an encoder and a decoder. An encoder network takes in an input, and converts it into a smaller, dense representation, which the decoder network can use to convert it back to the original input.Usually , the convolutional layers of any CNN take in a large image (eg. rank 3 tensor of size 28x28x3), and convert it to a much more compact, dense representation (eg. rank 1 tensor of size 10) which is then used by the fully connected classifier network to classify the image. Similary, the encoder network takes in an input and produces a much smaller representation that contains enough information for the decoder network to process and convert it into the desired output format. Autoencoders take this idea, and slightly flip it on its head, by making the encoder generate encodings specifically useful for reconstructing its own input.The entire network is usually trained as a whole. The loss function is usually either the mean-squared error or cross-entropy between the output and the input, known as the reconstruction loss, which penalizes the network for creating outputs different from the input.As the encoding has far less units than the input, the encoder must choose to discard information. The encoder learns to preserve as much of the relevant information as possible and discards the irrelevant stuff. The decoder learns to take the encoding and reconstruct it into a proper image. Together, they form an autoencoder network which indeed is quite successful in reconstructing the input data .Why Vartional Autoencoders?Standard autoencoders learn to generate compact representations and reconstruct their inputs well to a good accuracy level but the input data does not cover the entire latent space (where encoded vectors lie) . Due to this discontinuous latent space, the purpose of generating new data is not served by simple autoencoders .For example, training an autoencoder on the MNIST dataset, and visualizing the encodings from a 2D latent space reveals the formation of distinct clusters. This makes sense, as distinct encodings for each image type makes it far easier for the decoder to decode them. This is fine if you’re just replicating the same images.But when you’re building a generative model, you don’t want to prepare to replicate the same image you put in. You want to randomly sample from the latent space, or generate variations on an input image, from a continuous latent space.If the space has discontinuities (eg. gaps between clusters) and you sample/generate a variation from there, the decoder will simply generate an unrealistic output, because the decoder has no idea how to deal with that region of the latent space.Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have one fundamentally unique property that differentiates them from autoencoders : their latent spaces are, by design, continuous, allowing easy random sampling .This property that makes them so useful and accurate for generating dataKL divergenceIn this post we’re going to take a look at way of comparing two probability distributions called Kullback-Leibler Divergence (often shortened to just KL divergence). Very often in Probability and Statistics, we’ll replace observed data or a complex distributions with a simpler, approximating distribution. KL Divergence helps us to measure just how much information we lose when we choose an approximation.KL Divergence has its origins in information theory. The primary goal of information theory is to measure how much information is in data. The most important metric in information theory is called Entropy, typically denoted as H. Entropy of a probability distribution is defined as following : ,where common values of b are 2 or e and P(X) denotes the Probability mass function .Kullback-Leibler Divergence is just a slight modification of our formula for entropy. Rather than just having our probability distribution P ,we measure the difference of the log values of the approximating probability distribution Q    for discrete probability distributions    for continuous probability distributions Relating this with entropy,where H(P,Q) is the cross entropy of P and Q.We can observe here that by  minimizing the KL divergence of two probability distributions , we can make our approximating distribution more closer to the actual probability distribution and this optimization is tractable .Combining KL divergence with neural networks allows us to learn very complex approximating distribution for our data and this approach is used Variational  Autoencoders .Deep dive into VAEsThe unique property in VAEs which makes them so useful in maing generative models is that their latent space is continuous which allows random sampling .This happens because its encoder does not output an encoding vector of size n, rather, outputs two vectors of size n: a vector of means, μ, and another vector of standard deviations, σ . μ and σ now become the parameters for a vector of size n containing random values having mean and standard deviation as μ and σ respectively . This will result in random generation of data having mean and standard deviation close to the input data.  Hence,the mean vector controls where the encoding of an input should be centered around, while the standard deviation controls the area, how much from the mean the encoding can vary. As encodings are generated at random from anywhere inside the shaded portion, the decoder learns all the nearby points that refer to sample of that class . This allows the decoder to not just decode specific encodings in the latent space but also the ones which vary thus making the latent space continuous .We want our encodings to be as close as possible while still being distinct to make smooth interpolation, but sometimes we might end up making our latent space similar to the right picture shown above as there are no limits on what values vectors μ and σ can take on, so to avoid this , we introduce KL divergence in the loss function . The following image shows the calculation of the log of the data likelihood            Although the third term in intractable, by Gibbs inequality , we know that KL divergence of two distributions is always non-negative . Hence, the first two terms can be a tractable lower bound to the log data likelihood which we can easily differentiate (P(X      Z) is mostly a simple distribution like Guassian and KL term is also differntiable ) and hence optimize .The combination of first two terms is also known as Variational Lower Bound (“ELBO”) . The first term here is responsible for reconstructing the original input data and the second term is responsible for making approximate distribution close to input distribution .      Applications of VAEs  One can generate fake human face photos as accurate as the following  VAEs are highly successful in Vector arithmetic . For example, if we would like to add features like adding glasses on a face ,we can find two samples, one with glasses and one without, obtain their encoded vectors from the encoder, and save the difference. Add this new “glasses” vector to any other face image and decode it.  One could even train an autoencoder using LSTM encoder-decoder pairs for sequential, discrete data (something not possible with methods such as GANs), to produce synthetic text, or even interpolate between MIDI samples such as Google Brain’s Magenta’s MusicVAE .Supporting LinksSo I guess this is enough for a start. There is much to learn, but perhaps that would be covered in another article. I present to you a few useful links:  Tutorial on Variational autoencoder  KL divergence blog  Do read research papers related to this as literature survey is highly important to get a feel of it.",

      "content"  : "IntroductionHi all, welcome to the Programming Club Introductory Workshop 2017!SlackFirst of all, please join our slack at https://pclubiitk.slack.comand join the channel #y17 to receive future emails regarding events and other stufffrom slack announcements directly.TerminalTry opening Terminal (sometimes known as Command Line) from the top-left menus. You should find it in the ‘System’ applications.Mind it, some operating systems like Ubuntu might have a shortcut for this, you can open it using Ctrl+Alt+T, but not in the CC machines.This is where you should learn to do all stuff related to programming, since this gives you unfathomable power.Directory structureLinux organizes files and folders in the following way:  Files are kept inside folders  You can enter and exit folders just like in Windows  Folders are named in the following way: /path-to-folder/folder-name. This is what completely describes a folder (or a file).  We will be using the word directory for folders. Please note this.To play around with this, try to use the following commands:$ ls# Lists contents of current folder$ cd Desktop# Move to the folder named Desktop$ cd ..# Go Back to previous folder$ cd ~# Go back to home folder(where you start on opening a terminal)            Command      Full form      Description              ls      list screen      List all the files and folders in current directory              cd      change directory      Enter a folder whose path is known              pwd      present working directory      Full name of the current folder you are in              ~      tilde      Short form for your home folder              Ctrl+c(keyboard)             Exit/Cancel the current command              exit      Exit      Exit the terminal      GeditWe will be using gedit to write your programs. Find it from the applications menu and open it. Don’t be scared, it’s very much like notepad from Windows.PythonHere are a few python expressions:  a = 2+2  print &quot;hello world!&quot;  print a  print a*2Try typing all the above lines in gedit and then saving the file astest.py.Now after saving the file, you will need to navigate to its locationfrom the terminal. Once you are in the folder containing test.py suchthat ls shows test.py as one of the files, run:$ python test.pyThe output would be something like this:hello world!48You used an operator in a*2 - the multiplication operator. Other operators you need to try out are:            +      Addition              -      Subtraction              *      Multiplication              /      Division              **      To the power of      If/ElseNow that you know how to write simple things, let’s proceed to something interesting.Python reads spaces and tabs in your program as well. So for writing a complicatedinstruction for the computer, we will need to use multiple lines.We will indent the lines in such a way that the computer can understand thatthey are meant to be read together.Try the following:a = 0if a is not 0:    print &quot;a is not zero&quot;else:    print &quot;a is zero&quot;That’s it! See?Sometimes one condition isn’t enough though. In that case, you are allowed to chain up multiple conditions using and and or like so:a = 0b = 0if a is 1 or b is a:print &quot;Condition successful&quot;else:print &quot;condition failed&quot;That’s all good, but what if you want multiple checks on a variable? For example, let’s say you want to do Action 1 if a&amp;lt;10 and Action 2 if a=10 and Action 3 when a&amp;gt;10, what then? This is where if-elif-elif-elif-...-else construct comes into the picture. Use it like this:a = 4if a &amp;lt; 0:print &quot;a is less than 0&quot;elif a &amp;gt;= 0 and a &amp;lt; 4:print &quot;a is between 0 and 4&quot;elif a &amp;gt;= 4 and a &amp;lt; 10:print &quot;a is between 4 and 10&quot;else:print &quot;a is bigger than 10&quot;LoopsNow for some loopy-loops!a = 0while a &amp;lt; 10:    print a    a = a + 1Reading inputYou can read input from the user using something like this:a = raw_input()print &quot;Hello mr. &quot; + ab = int(raw_input())print b + 5See what happens there?CodeChef!Try this link hereCan you solve this problem? Try writing a program for this! Please give it a try before you scroll down.It’s quite small! Here’s the solution!while True:    x = int(raw_input())    if x == 42:        break    print xSo you should now certainly create an account on CodeChef! Try submitting the solution there (don’t forget to select Python when you submit). Happy coding!Python InterpreterTry running python command in the terminal. You should see something like:Python 2.7.10 (default, Aug 12 2017, 22:05:31)[GCC 4.9.3] on linux2Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is the place where you type. Try typing the some of thecommands up like:  2+2  print “hello world!”Follow upCongrats on finishing up to here! If you’re now pumped up for trying out some more challenges, try your hand at the following problems:  ATM  Factorial  Enormous Input Test  The Lead GameNote C/C++/Java are commonly the preferred languages while participating in competitive contests. Recently, ACM ICPC has started allowing Python as well.",

      "content"  : "  Place Linux Mint DVD or USB bootable image in the appropriate drive and reboot the computer in order to start with Linux Mint 18 installation.  After reboot, press the special function key and instruct the machine firmware (UEFI) to boot-up from the appropriate DVD or USB drive (the special function keys usually are F1, F8, F12, F10, F2 or sometimes del, depending on the motherboard manufacturer). Once the media boots-up a new screen should appear on your monitor. Choose Start Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon and hit Enter to continue.  Wait until the system loads into RAM in order to run in live-mode and open the installer by double clicking on Install Linux Mint icon. Choose the language you wish to perform the installation and click on Continue button to proceed further.  On the next screen hit on Continue button to proceed further. Third-party software can be automatically download and installed on this step by checking the check-box. The recommendation would be to leave the box unchecked for the moment and manually install proprietary software later, after the installation process completes.   At the next screen you can choose the Installation Type. If Windows Boot manager is automatically detected you can choose to Install Linux Mint alongside Windows Boot Manager. This option ensures that the HDD will be automatically partitioned by the installer without any data loss.The second option, Erase disk and install Linux Mint, should be avoided for dual-boot because is potentially dangerous and will wipe-out your disk. For a more flexible partition layout you should go with Something else option and hit on Continue button to proceed further.  Now let’s create the partition layout for Linux Mint 18. I would recommend that you create three partitions, one for / (root), one for /home accounts data and one partition for swap. Swap partition is necessary if you have RAM less than 8 GB, if you have RAM greater than 8GB, feel free to leave making the swap partition. Select the free space and hit on the + icon from below. On this partition use the following settings and hit OK to create the partition.    Size = 4096 MBType for for the new partition = Beginning of this spaceUse as = swap area        Using the same steps as above create the /(root) partition with the below settings:    Size = minimum 20 GBType for the new partition = PrimaryLocation for the new partition = Beginning of this spaceUse as = EXT4 journaling file systemMount point = /        Finally, create the home slice with the below settings (use all the available free space to create home partition). Home partition is the place where all documents for user accounts will be stored by default, except the root account. In case of a system failure you can reinstall the operating system for scratch without touching or losing the settings and documents of all users.    Size = remaining free spaceType for the new partition = PrimaryLocation for the new partition = Beginning Use as = EXT4 journaling file systemMount point = /home            After finishing creating the partition layout, select Windows Boot Manager as the device for installing the Grub boot loader and hit on Install Now button in order to commit changes to disk and proceed with the installation.

Make free space of at least 8 - 10 GB.  Turn off FastBoot and then Secure Boot.  Boot using the Installation USB.  Select “Graphical Install” or “Install”  Select language, location, keymap(American English works)  Let it detect network hardware. If you’re using a LAN cable with a properlyconfigured router(recommended), it should detect DHCP automatically. If not, youcan set it up manually(like you set for your room). LAN cable is still recommended, since wireless may not work out of the box.  Enter hostname (your choice).  Make a root(admin) password. You can leave this empty(which is absolutely OK, since the systemthen makes your user a ‘sudo-er’ (you can perform actions as root using ‘sudo’ command).  Setup your user. Enter name, username, password.  Let the clock be setup and wait for the partioner to open.  Choose the ‘Manual’ method for partitioning.   Select the partition with free space that you’ve just created in step 2. Select ‘Automatically Partition the free space’ and proceed. Select ‘All Files in new partition’.   Finish partitioning and write the changes to disk.  Configure the package manager to not scan any extra CD/DVD.  You can select a network mirror if you want, but if you’re using a DVD, it is not needed.If you do use one, select ‘India’ as your country and iitk as your mirror.  Choose whether you want to take part in a user survey.  Select the software you want to install (GNOME or another DE is recommended).  Choose whether to use nonfree and contrib software (you can, it usually helps).  Install grub. It should detect MS Windows. If not, you can always set it up later(This won’t erase Windows!)   Choose your hard drive (usually /dev/sda) when choosing where to install grub.  Installation is complete, reboot.",

From the menu select Install Ubuntu and press Enter.    After this a completely functional Ubuntu system running in live-mode will start up. On the launcher on left side hit on the second icon from top, Install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and the installer utility will start. Choose language and hit Continue.  In Preparing to install ubuntu click Continue.  In Installation type check the Something else option and hit on Continue button to proceed furthur.      Now we create three partitions one for root, one for swap and other for home. To create the swap partition and the root partition select the free space (the shrink space from windows created earlier) and hit on the + icon below one by one. Swap partition is for when RAM gets depleted so if you have RAM greater than 8 GB, feel free to leave making the swap partition. On partition settings use the following configurations and hit OK to continue:       Size = 4096 MB   Location for the new partition = Beginning   Mount = swap area   Size = at least 20000 MB   Type for the new partition = Primary   Location for the new partition = Beginning   Use as = EXT4 journaling file system   Mount point = /            Create the home partition using the same steps as above.

A basic installation with   all packages from the base group should take less than 800 MB of disk   space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a   remote repository, a working internet connection is required.Note : All commands will look like this:   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE   # some_command   #+END_EXAMPLE   The =some_command= portion is supposed to be typed after the prompt which is usually:   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE   root@archiso ~ #   #+END_EXAMPLE** Set the keyboard layout     See Archwiki installation page if you really need this, i.e., your keyboard     is not working as expected.** Verify the boot mode If UEFI mode is enabled on an UEFI motherboard, Archiso will boot Arch Linux accordingly via systemd-boot. To verify this, list the efivars directory: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars #+END_EXAMPLE** Connect to the Internet For wired connection with *DHCP* (for example - academic area), just connecting a LAN cord to your ethernet port should start the connection. You can verify connection on iitk network with the following command: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # ping 172.31.1.1 #+END_EXAMPLE For networks requiring static ip (such as your rooms), first stop dhcpcd service with ~systemctl stop dhcpcd@&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;~ (Here =&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;= refers to pressing the TAB key on the keyboard) and then see: [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl#Wired][ArchWiki Network Configuration]]   For wireless connections, use: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # wifi-menu #+END_EXAMPLE to connect to available networks. You can check connection using the previous command.** Update the system clock  Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # timedatectl set-ntp true #+END_EXAMPLE  To check the service status, use ~timedatectl status~.** Partition the disks You might have already partitioned your disks from windows if you have seen the parent guide of this post. So, you will have 3 partitions:   * One partition for the root directory / - approx 50-100gb.   * A swap partition of approximately your RAM size.** Format the partitions Once the partitions have been created, each must be formatted with an appropriate file system. For a list of partitions use: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # lsblk -o name,size,type,mountpoint,fstype NAME                                                       SIZE TYPE MOUNTPOINT FSTYPE sda                                                      931.5G disk ├─sda1                                                     260M part            vfat ├─sda2                                                      16M part ├─sda3                                                   416.2G part            ntfs ├─sda4                                                     808M part            ntfs ├─sda5                                                      12G part            swap ├─sda6                                                      10G part            ext4 ├─sda7                                                      50G part            ext4 ├─sda8                                                   308.5G part            ext4 ├─sda9                                                    68.4G part            ext4 ├─sda10                                                     50G part            ext4 ├─sda11                                                    694M part            ntfs └─sda12                                                   13.6G part            ntfs #+END_EXAMPLE Now, in the example above, my main harddisk is =/dev/sda=, yours can be anything. From now on, I will refer to it as =/dev/sdx= (=x= = variable corresponding to your harddisk). Now find the partitions you created. They will probably be the ones with the highest index (it&#39;s still your job to verify that). To format the main root partition (let it be /dev/sdxr) (the 50-100 gb one), use: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxr #+END_EXAMPLE where =r= is the number of the root partition from the output of ~lsblk~ Swap partition is required if you have RAM less than 8 GB, else you can leave it out if you want. To format the swap partition (the partition with the same size as your RAM), use: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxs #+END_EXAMPLE where =s= is the number of the swap partition from the output of ~lsblk~ To format the home partition, use: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxh #+END_EXAMPLE where =h= is the number of the home partition from the output of ~lsblk~** Mount the file systems Mount the root partition to =/mnt=, for example: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # mount /dev/sdxh /mnt #+END_EXAMPLE Find out if your computer uses UEFI or not. The best way (I know) is to verify whether you have a =vfat= partition (as in my case =/dev/sda1=). If yes, then: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # mkdir /mnt/boot # mkdir /mnt/home # mount /dev/sdxh /mnt/home # mount /dev/sdxe /mnt/boot #+END_EXAMPLE (Here =/dev/sdxe= is the =vfat= partition) This new partition which we are mounting to boot is Windows EFI Partition which containes Windows Boot Manager. Also remember this info(whether you have a UEFI system or not) for one of the future steps. Mount the swap partition: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # mkswap /dev/sdxs #+END_EXAMPLE** Installation** Select the mirrors Packages to be installed must be downloaded from mirror servers, which are defined in =/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist=. Since we are in iitk, we will use the iitk mirrors. For that, use =nano=: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist #+END_EXAMPLE And insert these line at the very top just below the initial comments in this order: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE Server = http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch Server = http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch #+END_EXAMPLE** Install the base packages Use the pacstrap script to install the base package group and other useful stuff: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # pacstrap /mnt base dialog iw wpa_supplicant sudo #+END_EXAMPLE** Configure the system** Fstab Generate an fstab file: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # genfstab -U /mnt &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /mnt/etc/fstab #+END_EXAMPLE** Chroot Change root into the new system: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # arch-chroot /mnt #+END_EXAMPLE** Time zone Set the time zone (probably =Asia/Kolkata=, since you live in India): #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime #+END_EXAMPLE  Run hwclock(8) to generate =/etc/adjtime=: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # hwclock --systohc --localtime #+END_EXAMPLE** Locale Open =/etc/locale.gen= using =nano=: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # nano /etc/locale.gen #+END_EXAMPLE Go to the line and remove the first =#=: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE #en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 #+END_EXAMPLE Generate localisations with (execute): #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # locale-gen #+END_EXAMPLE Open =/etc/locale.conf= using =nano= and add the following line: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE LANG=en_US.UTF-8 #+END_EXAMPLE** Hostname Create the =/etc/hostname= file. A hostname is a name for your pc (You can set that to anything consisting of only letters): #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE myhostname #+END_EXAMPLE You will need to add a matching entry to =/etc/hosts= (the last line): #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost ::1             localhost.localdomain   localhost 127.0.1.1       myhostname.localdomain  myhostname #+END_EXAMPLE** Root password Set the root password: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # passwd #+END_EXAMPLE** Boot loader If you have an Intel CPU, install the intel-ucode package #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # pacman -S intel-ucode #+END_EXAMPLE Now, you need to remember if you have a UEFI system or not.***** No UEFI  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  # pacman -S grub os-prober ntfs-3g  # grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdx  # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg  #+END_EXAMPLE  Please replace =x= with the character of your harddisk.***** UEFI  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  # pacman -S grub os-prober efibootmgr ntfs-3g  # grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=grub  # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg  #+END_EXAMPLE***** After       The above steps may sometimes fail to recognize windows. Don’t panic, see the reboot section.** New User Now, its time to create a new user: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash &amp;lt;username&amp;gt; #+END_EXAMPLE Here, a new user was added with the username you give and default shell =/bin/bash=. Just changing the username should suffice for most people. To change the user&#39;s password: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE # passwd the_username_you_just_set #+END_EXAMPLE Now setup =sudo= by typing ~visudo~. This opens up the sudo configuration file in =vim=. Press =&amp;lt;Shift&amp;gt; + g= to goto the end of the file. Now go up, till you see this line: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ## Uncomment the below line to allow members of group wheel to execute any command # %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL #+END_EXAMPLE Now, carefully place your cursor on the =#= just before =%wheel= and press =x=. This will remove the =#=. It will now look like this: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command  %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL #+END_EXAMPLE Now type =:wq= to save and exit. This should give your user sudo rights.** RebootExit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing =Ctrl+D=.Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with ~umount -R /mnt~:Finally, restart the machine by typing ~reboot~. Now while booting choose   grub as the default boot option.After booting, you will encounter a black screen with option to login.   You can now log in with your user.** Post Reboot GRUB Fix     If your Windows did not show up during boot, run this command and check if windows     shows up on a reboot:     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE     # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg     #+END_EXAMPLE** Post-installationSee [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/General_recommendations][General Recommendations]] for system management directions and   post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user   interface, sound or a touchpad).For a list of applications that may be of interest, see [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications][List of applications]].",

Then follow the steps to install Ubuntu.        After installation click “Keep trying Ubuntu”        Shut down (NOT RESTART) your computer, remove installation media, hit enter.        Hold down shift then press the power button to turn on your computer. (holding down shift while powering on will load the grub boot menu)        When the grub boot menu appears press “e” and make the changes in step 3.        Press “f10”        Once your back into the desktop open your terminal. Press Ctrl+Alt+T if touch pad is not working and enter:    sudo gedit /etc/default/grub        Find the line that reads ‘GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”‘ and change it to read    ‘GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 acpi_osi=Linux i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 idle=nomwait”‘        Ignore this step if touchpad is working else add i8042.reset to read:    ‘GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”i8042.reset quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 acpi_osi=Linux i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 idle=nomwait”‘        Save the changes then exit gedit.        In your terminal run the command: sudo update-grub        Reboot your computer: sudo reboot.        The PC may hang at this point which means the OS doesn’t support restart with dual boot.        Force switch off the PC from power button and on next boot follow steps 13-17 and add acpi=force in step 14/15 to read:    ‘GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 acpi_osi=Linux i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 idle=nomwait acpi=force”‘  Enjoy UbuntuGNOME!!!!Next, we need to install Nvidia Drivers.

Verify Nvidia installation (shows a nice table with nvidia hardware and driver specs):    nvidia-smi        Use “nvidia-X-server” from applications or following command to select profile for next boot (available profiles are intel and nvidia)    sudo prime-select nvidia    If you are not a beginner and wish to switch profiles without reboot use: https://github.com/matthieugras/Prime-Ubuntu-18.04.Potential ProblemsIf anything goes wrong during driver installation, you are likely to get a black screen. In that case follow these steps touninstall nvidia:      Try “Ctrl+Alt+F1”. if console opens simply login and go to step 5 else force shutdown the PC.        Hold shift and power on the computer.        Select “advanced options” and then “recovery mode”.        Select root and press enter key twice. You will be dropped in root shell.        Run this command    apt purge nvidia*        Reboot    reboot        You can either retry the above steps to install nvidia-drivers or use ubuntu with intel card.  Windows update which requires multiple restarts would be problem because grub selects ubuntu as default. This may lead tocrashing of windows. Switching OFF automatic updates is RECOMMENDED. In case, you want to do an update :      Make windows first boot option from boot manager.    Grub-&amp;gt;system setup-&amp;gt;boot tab-&amp;gt;change boot order(swap 1st and second option)        Perform the update and shut down the PC.        Press esc repeatedly to open boot menu. Select enter setup.        Restore the boot tab to previous settings.  Source: ubuntugnome-16-04-on-asus-rog-gl552v",

      "content"  : "Web Development Lecture Series: IntroductionBasics of what the browser doesHere we briefly describe the back-breaking work the browser does, every time you open your favorite websites.The internet does not understand facebook.com. Yet, everything on the internet has an address. How does this work?There is a protocol called IP, which provides a numeric address to every computer on the internet. So when you open pclub.in, your computer somehow figures out where the files for the website are stored. Here, we mean that your computer has to find out how to locate the machine storing the files for pclub.in. Here is what happens:  Your browser talks to a machine called DNS Server, which converts pclub.in to an IP address. In this case, it is 192.30.252.153.  This IP address is where the files are to be found. So now your computer tells the internet to provide the files placed at that location.  The machine pointed to by the IP address above (the computer which stores the files of the website) is called the server.  The first file to be loaded is an HTML web page. This is something which describes the structure of the page, what it contains, and what all other images etc need to be fetched.  The browser reads the HTML file, and figures out the extra files it will need to fetch for that.  It fetches some CSS files (for styling), some JS files (for interactive behavior), and images.  The above files need not all be on pclub.in. I could link to some image lying at some other website’s location, and the browser would repeat the same procedure as above for that file, finding that website’s location and then getting the image.Exploring the files being receivedHere’s a simple exercise. Open a new tab in your browser, and press F12. You will see a (scary looking?) panel pop up, to your right or at the bottom. Don’t lose heart, it isn’t all that scary :) It is called Developer Tools, or related terms, depending on the context.Now you need to click on the tab named Network in that panel. Once you’ve done that, open up pclub.in.It would probably look somewhat like in the images below.For Chrome:For Firefox:I’ll be referring to the Google Chrome image.  Note the first entry in the list. It says pclub.in. That means that you made a request for pclub.in. You can even see when it finished in the bars on the right.  Some css files follow that request. They are necessary for making the page look good, and provide all the styling information.  A little down, there is an entry called pclub.png. That was a request made for the main PClub image, and as you can see, it made it to your screen.There are plenty more files, which we don’t need to know about so soon. We urge you to give this a shot, try this yourself, and explore (Google) more on this.PrerequisitesWe’ll hope that you have some knowledge of programming, and are comfortable with using a computer.In addition, it will be highly preferred if you are using a Linux/Mac machine. Windows imposes restrictions on things you can do, gives you no way of doing things it has no softwares for, and is not Open Source (which, Mac is not too). Nonetheless, we hope that you install SSH and SCP clients on your windows machines, so that you can copy your files to the IIT Kanpur servers and get your homepage ready. Linux users don’t need any special software in most cases (ensure that ssh command is working in your terminal).Some softwares you should have installed for Windows (before the lecture) are:  WinSCP  PuTTY  PSCPAlso, to be able to benefit from the lecture, you are strongly recommended to get your IITK Homepage directory made BEFORE the lecture. If time permits, we will cover some of that too.Here are the Official instructions on how to make your homepage:Creating Personal Homepage. You need to look at the section saying For uploading and downloading and editing (using WinSCP).Topics to be coveredHere’s a brief description of what this series will attempt to cover, and what those topics are.HTMLSay you need to design a poster, how would you go about doing that?You begin with a vague idea. Perhaps you want a title, followed by a subtitle. A title image would be good too. Some text in paragraphs, and some more images.Note that the things which immediately come to mind describe the structure of the poster. You could later on choose to write things in a pretty font, display images to the right; or even choose to make the font size in the paragraphs larger than the title itself. This all is secondary. What you initially need to know is, what is the structure of the document.On the web, that is precisely what HTML does. HTML, (or Hyper Text Markup Language) is a templating language, meaning that it let’s you create a template of what structure you have in mind. Displaying it nicely is a whole other matter, which we will look at later.Here are some of the things which are preferably done in HTML, for a web page:  Title of the page (the one which is displayed as the name of the current tab)  Information about the web page for browsers  The body of the webpage, which you see.  Images in the web page  Text in the web page  Subdividing text into paragraphs  Adding whitespace (newlines, spaces etc)  Some simple styling of webpages (not recommended)  Add links to other pages  Quite more :)CSSNow suppose you need to show something in a colored font on your webpage, or you want an image to display on the right side of the webpage instead of the left.How do you do that? Thanks to the structured form of HTML, it is possible to label and identify items in your website’s structure (maybe you need to refer to all images, maybe only the images inside a particular paragraph, who knows?). Using this, you can define rules for every particular set of items on your web page.HTML and CSS alone form the majority of the visible part of the websites you see. The design of the pclub.in website, how google.com looks, Google’s new material design websites; most of the styling is still done in CSS (apart from some complicated, dynamic ones). CSS is what you use to design your websites, make them look pretty (or ugly if you want to), and even add some animations!For an example, try navigating to the ‘contact’ page on pclub.in. Try hovering your mouse above any of the images, or names of the secretaries. The smooth animation you see was implemented with a few standard lines of CSS :)JavaScriptYou’ve got an idea about how to describe the structure of a document, you even know how to put some style to it. But how do you handle clicks?One simple thing is to put links. That could open up a new page. But what if you want the click to, say, change some text on the page? Or maybe you’re making an online game, and you want it to use some buttons. Think YouTube, and how it handles the Play button. How do you describe what should happen when you click something?Also, you’ve seen some simple animations. Did you notice the animation for We’re the PClub on the programming club website homepage? The alphabets appear one by one, after a certain time delay. How do you do that?What about Facebook, how does it get more information when you scroll down, and display it on the same page?What we’ve described above are actual programming challenges, not just styling and structuring problems. JavaScript is the de-facto language of the internet, and it is what helps us describe all the above actions in a way computers understand. JavaScript is in itself, a full fledged programming language, and you can do quite a bit using it. It is what makes websites responsive. These files have an extension of .js.Node.js (and other Backend languages like PHP)All you’ve seen till now is what is called the frontend. Everything was happening on the browser (which is called the client side). The machine hosting the website (as we mentioned in the very start) only has to send the html, css, js files to the browser, which interprets these files. Websites comprising only of that type of items are called static websites. Think of, example.com, or cse.iitk.ac.in. These websites have content which changes rarely, and is manually updated by updating the files stored on the host computer (called the server).How about Facebook? People post thousands of images every minute, yet it does not create a separate html page for everyone every 1 second. In such cases, the server is not only sending static content (html, css, js), but is also responding to complex queries. When you log in, you send an HTTP request (google this term!) to the server, with your password. It then verifies that it is correct, and lets you in. On this, it looks up in its store of information (called the Database), and generates data to display to you. This is how you get this information. The user’s browser sends more HTTP Requests to the server, say asking for new items in your news feed. The server responds by providing that information, and the browser takes that information, and JavaScript converts that information into content you can see on your screen.ConclusionThe above is a (fairly-long) description of the various things necessary to be known to be able to do some serious web development. Don’t worry if you don’t understand parts of it, you’ll come to know eventually, when you cover the topics in more detail. Till then, happy Googling!",

Training data should be large enough (at least 60,000 sets) in order to predict the output precisely. In our project we are testing our model on a validation set and printing the accuracy as final output.What we learntAfter completing this project we became well versed with Lua and Torch. Also, one learns the basic concepts involved in the construction of neural networks and the various machine learning algorithms.How to useInstall torch from this link.Download free forex data from here and convert the csv file into txt file separated by ;.This data will form your training and validation set. Download the code from here and run on your system by using th filenameYou will also see a graph plot between the expected value and predicted value.How does the code workWell, the program uses gradient descent algorithm and uses a test data set to train itself. This is necessary for the program to learn and this model is saved. Now, this saved model is reloaded in a new program and there it predicts the values for the validation set. Then the actual values and obtained values are obtained on the graph.",

      "content"  : "IntroductionFree Libre and open-source software (FLOSS) is computer software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. Free, open-source operating systems such as GNU/Linux are widely utilised today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones (e.g. Android), and other devices.[1]HistoryIt is common knowledge, from the 1950’s to the 70’s, the common trend for developers and users was to freely share source code with one another, and used to tailor it for their needs.However, in the 70’s and early 80’s, the evolving software industry began to directly sell software, which usually was in the form of binary copies, thereby preventing users to reverse engineer the software. In 1980, the copyright law in the States was extended to software programs.In 1983, Richard Stallman at the MIT AI Laboratory, announced the GNU Project. Along with the GNU OS development, the Free Software Foundation a.k.a. FSF was founded in 1985. The GNU Manifesto contained the GNU philosophy of Free Software definition and “copyleft” ideas.The Linux kernel was released as a freely modifiable open source software in 1991, which was relicensed under the GNU GPL in 1992.FreeBSD and NetBSD were released as free software in 1993. In 1995, the Apache Web Server (A patchy web server, there is sure history behind its name :P) was released.Then came a revolutionary moment in 1998. The Netscape Corporation released its famous Netscape Communicator Suite as free software. (I am sure you guys must have heard Firefox and ThunderBird. Yeah, that is the descendant of the Netscape; however, another story, another time).Netscape saw business potential in collaborating and sharing source code, however the FSF and its ideals were not not appealing enough to them. Hence, they decided to rebrand the movement; coining the famous “open source” and the Open Source Initiative was established in February, 1998. In 2001, the European Commission introduced the term FLOSS, which has been in both popular and official use since 2004.[2]Licensing : An important partSince the establishment of the GNU Project, there have been ideas floating around for an explicit open source license. The GNU General Public License v1.0 was thus released in 1989, with v2.0 coming in 1991.Various popular licenses pertaining to Free software, as approved by the OSI are:   [3]      Apache License 2.0        BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” license        BSD 2-Clause “Simplified” or “FreeBSD” license        GNU General Public License (GPL)        GNU Library or “Lesser” General Public License (LGPL)        MIT license        Mozilla Public License 2.0        Common Development and Distribution License        Eclipse Public License  Check out these licenses and their full texts at the OSI website.GNU/LinuxOne can’t write an article on FLOSS, and skip out GNU/Linux. There is quite a lot of history surrounding the most popular OSS Linux kernel, and it sure is a favourite amongst developers and the community alike.There are a lot of Operating systems (referred to as linux distributions) based on the linux kernel, popular ones beingUbuntuArguably the largest used linux OS in PCs around the world, it is quite popular amongst the people entering the dynamic world of open source. A clean graphical user interface, with the nix terminal; it provides an easy transition from Windows to Linux. It is based on the Debian distribution. [4]Check out the Ubuntu website for more details.Kali LinuxKali Linux is a security testing distro. (Of course, it does have a cool interface :P).Elementary OSElementary OS is a distribution based on Ubuntu, and borrows its looks from the Mac OS X.Gentoo LinuxGentoo is a distribution which, in my opinion, stands apart from others in the list. It is an OS, which you actually have to compile and install. Honestly speaking, I never had the chance to compile and install it myself, but I have seen people do it, and mind you; I have not come across an operating system so configurable during installation. For the record, I’ve heard it is fun using and installing. Do check out the Gentoo website.I would not recommend this operating system to users new to the Linux environment; but after all, we stumble when we learn to walk.Arch LinuxThe aim of Arch Linux is to Keep It Simple Stupid. Historically, Arch was sometimes described as “Linux, with a nice package manager.” Arch does not aim to be your friendly, caring operating system; which would do stuff for you. Instead, it is very customisable and favours architectural simplicity and avoids over-engineering. [5]ApricityOSAnother linux distribution with great aesthetics. It is based on the Arch Linux OS, and uses GNOME or Cinnamon as the Graphical User Interface.Credits:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#History  https://opensource.org/licenses  http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/ubuntu-and-debian  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_compared_to_other_distributions",

Mathematical soultions of this problem are not possible, so numerical methods are necessary for visualisation. The problem basically involves several bodies with defined properties and also a well defined force that acts between each of these bodies, and involves studying how the system evolves with time. Parallel programming is used for increasing performance, and problems of this type are ideally suited for the parallel programming paradigm.^ This is a screenshot of a simulation in action with 5 bodies.

      "content"  : "Dynamic Programming Optimisation with  Convex Hull Trick :Why Dynamic programming?      Dynamic programming is a very useful method for solving a particular class of problems in which the problem is broken into smaller sub-problems and the optimal solution of sub-problems contribute towards the optimal solution of given problem.        If you are new to Dynamic Programming you can read a good tutorial here:link1        Most of the problems solved by DP(dynamic programming) seem to be of brute force type, but you can identify them by observing the repetative calculation of sub-problems and by formulating a recursive relationship to get the optimal soution.  What’s a Convex Hull Trick?      Although it seems to be related to the Convex Hull Algorithm from its name, but it’s not. It is a “trick”, as its name suggests, in which from a set of linear function, the function which attains the extreme value for an independent variable is obtained effeciently by some preprocessing. Only because the soultion looks like an open convex polygon it is known as “Convex Hull Trick”.        For simple understanding, consider N lines of the form:    y=mix+ci , ∀ i ∈[1,N]        The problem is to find the line with extremum value of y for a particular value of x.Let’s consider finding the minimum value of y.            From the figure you can see that the parts of lines marked as lower envelope gives us the required solution.        Few simple observations that can be made are :          A part of line can be the solution for a continuous range of x.      As x increases, the slope of the required line keeps on decreasing and these parts of lines form an open convex hull.            So, if you are given the set of lines initially, the you can sort the lines with decresasing value of slope and add then build the solution based on their point of intersection.            To build the solution you should discard the lines that can’t be a part of the solution. As you can see the above image, the slopes of lines are such that :    mm &amp;gt; ml &amp;gt; mn    First, consider you have only lines m &amp;amp; l. Then, add the line n to the set of line. Here, you can see that the x-co-ordinate of point C is less than the x-co-ordinate of point A. Hence, the line n attains minimum value even before the line l. From this you can see that the line l can be discarded from the solution set.    After discarding all such unnecessary lines, you can maintain the lines with decresing slope and the x-co-ordinate of its point of intersection with its previous line. (Observe that these x-co-ordinates will be in increasing order).      For the query, you can do binary search on the x-co-ordinate  of point of intersections and and get the line with the minimum value of y effeciently in Ο(logN), where N is number of lines.        PreProcessing time: Ο(NlogN).        There is also a fully dynamic variant of this Convex Hull Trick in which the lines are added during the query time. For this a data structure like set can be used which maintain the sorted list of slopes of lines dynamically. The only difference is after each insertion of a new line(insertion of slope) into set, we check its intersection with its neighbouring elements in set and decide wheathter to discard it or not using the same condition as stated above. We should also check if any line already present in the set is discarded after the insertion of the line.    You can also try solving this problem here, which is based on direct implementation of its dynamic variant.How can you optimise DP with Convex Hull Trick?      In some specific problems that can be solved by Dynamic Programming we can do faster calculation of the state using the Convex Hull Trick. In these type of problems, the recursive relation between the states is as follows:          dpi = min(bj*ai + dpj) ,where j ∈ [1,i-1]      bi &amp;gt; bj ,∀ i&amp;lt;j.        Our task is to calculate dpN from this relation. Here bi and dpi can be analogously interpreted as the slope and y-intercept for a line, and our problem of calculating the i’th state can be viewed as finding the minimum value of a line for x-co-ordinate ai,which can be effeciently done using the convex hull trick.The slopes of the are given in the decreasing order here, so after calculating dpi we can add a line with slope bi and y-intercept dpi directly to the right of the sorted list maintained for calculating further states.        In the above problem if we directly calculate dpi by taking i-1 steps for each i, the the time complexity turns out to be Ο(N2), but by using this optimisation technique we can calculate each state in Ο(logN) and the total complexity of the problem reduces to Ο(NlogN)    This problem can also be more constrained by a condition:          ai &amp;lt; aj, ∀ i&amp;lt;j.        In this case, as we know that the x-co-ordinates are in increasing order, we can just maintain a pointer to the line giving minimunm value and then update the pointer to the next line according to the query. Here the steps taken for binary search are replaced by some amortised constant steps to update the pointer to the next lines(decreasing slope order). So, the calculation of eachstate takes time Ο(1) and the total time complexity reduces to Ο(N)        If there if no constraints given for ai and bi, then you can relate the problem with the dynamic variant of Convex Hull Trick. For this problem, we use the data structure set that maintains the lines in decreasing order of slopes along with dynamic insertions. Each insertion of line into set takes time Ο(logN) and calculation of each state takes time Ο(logN). So, the total time complexity will be Ο(NlogN). You should be cautious in using set when you are given a constraint  for bi because even though by both ways you get Ο(NlogN), set has a high proportionality time constant.

      "content"  : "IntroductionHi all, welcome to the Programming Club Introductory Workshop 2016!TerminalTry opening Terminal (sometimes known as Command Line) from the top-left menus. You should find it in the ‘System’ applications.Mind it, some operating systems like Ubuntu might have a shortcut for this, you can open it using Ctrl+Alt+T, but not in the CC machines.This is where you should learn to do all stuff related to programming, since this gives you unfathomable power.Directory structureLinux organizes files and folders in the following way:  Files are kept inside folders  You can enter and exit folders just like in Windows  Folders are named in the following way: /path-to-folder/folder-name. This is what completely describes a folder (or a file).  We will be using the word directory for folders. Please note this.To play around with this, try to use the following commands:            Command      Full form      Description              ls      list screen      List all the files and folders in current directory              cd      change directory      Enter a folder whose path is known              pwd      present working directory      Full name of the current folder you are in              ~      tilde      Short form for your home folder              Ctrl+c(keyboard)             Exit/Cancel the current command              exit      Exit      Exit the terminal      GeditWe will be using gedit to write your programs. Find it from the applications menu and open it. Don’t be scared, it’s very much like notepad from Windows.PythonTry running python command in the terminal. You should see something like:Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul  6 2016, 22:05:31) [GCC 4.9.3] on linux2Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is the place where you type. Try typing the following:  2+2  print “hello world!”  print a (you should get an error)  a = 4  print a*2You used an operator in a*2 - the multiplication operator. Other operators you need to try out are:            +      Addition              -      Subtraction              *      Multiplication              /      Division              **      To the power of      If/ElseNow that you know how to write simple things, let’s proceed to something interesting.Python reads spaces and tabs in your program as well. So for writing a complicated instruction for the computer, we will need to use multiple lines. We will indent the lines in such a way that the computer can understand that they are meant to be read together.Try the following:a = 0if a is not 0:    print &quot;a is not zero&quot;else:    print &quot;a is zero&quot;That’s it! See?Sometimes one condition isn’t enough though. In that case, you are allowed to chain up multiple conditions using and and or like so:a = 0b = 0if a is 1 or b is a:print &quot;Condition successful&quot;else:print &quot;condition failed&quot;That’s all good, but what if you want multiple checks on a variable? For example, let’s say you want to do Action 1 if a&amp;lt;10 and Action 2 if a=10 and Action 3 when a&amp;gt;10, what then? This is where if-elif-elif-elif-...-else construct comes into the picture. Use it like this:a = 4if a &amp;lt; 0:print &quot;a is less than 0&quot;elif a &amp;gt;= 0 and a &amp;lt; 4:print &quot;a is between 0 and 4&quot;elif a &amp;gt;= 4 and a &amp;lt; 10:print &quot;a is between 4 and 10&quot;else:print &quot;a is bigger than 10&quot;LoopsNow for some loopy-loops!a = 0while a &amp;lt; 10:    print a    a = a + 1Reading inputYou can read input from the user using something like this:a = raw_input()print &quot;Hello mr. &quot; + ab = int(raw_input())print b + 5See what happens there?CodeChef!Try this link hereCan you solve this problem? Try writing a program for this! Please give it a try before you scroll down.It’s quite small! Here’s the solution!while True:    x = int(raw_input())    if x == 42:        break    print xSo you should now certainly create an account on CodeChef! Try submitting the solution there (don’t forget to select Python when you submit). Happy coding!CCreate a file called hello.c with the following content:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;int main() {  printf(&quot;Hello World\\n&quot;);  return 0;}CompilingTo actually run the code, execute the following command on the terminal:gcc -o hello hello.cThe above command tells the computer to create an executable called hello (The part after -o) using the code from the file hello.c.Now to run the executable, type:./helloin the terminal.Follow upCongrats on finishing up to here!

For each pair of nodes u and v that are connected, the distance between them is 1 unit, however it takes c(u,v) litres of petrol to cross it (weird, isn’t it?). Each node in TreeTop has a petrol pump in which one can fill the tank of their car to the fullest. The fact that there is a pump in every node means that the tank of the car only needs to have that c(u, v) litres of petrol to cross the edge u-v.Rose also has K dollars. She has to decide a certain capacity for the tank of the car. Given a certain capacity for the tank, results in certain roads not being crossed (for example. if the tank’s capacity is 6 litres and c(u,v) is 10 then the car can’t go from u to v or vice versa). Of Course, when some roads can’t be crossed, TreeTop decomposes into a forest (number of disjoint trees). For each tree in the forest, Rose has to assign some node in that tree as a centre. The cost of assigning a particular node as a centre is the sum of the distances of all nodes in that tree from the centre. Rose has to ensure that the cost of setting up centres in all the trees in the forest is less than or equal to K dollars.Rose wants to choose the maximum capacity of the petrol tank so that the cost of setting up centres is not more than K.

      "content"  : "HTML5 Game DevelopmentFor all those gaming nerds out there, there isn’t a better way to develop your gaming skills but to start from scratch of how a game works and to build your own one!HTML 5 provides rich environment to create your games using Javascript and the html5 canvas object.PRE-REQUISITESWell all you need is to know the basics of html and javascript. And of course a little bit of enthu in the pot is forever welcomed !  :)WHY NOT OTHER GAME-ENGINES ?We have hundreds of cool game engines in the market, to name few unity,unreal engine, cryengine, source 2 etc. But here we focus on learning things from the scratch, in engines like these things are more  drag and drop and the essence of how things work from the basic fails to deliver. In this article we discuss things from the very basic !GAME CANVAS AND GAME COMPONENTSWithout much ado, we talk about the canvas object in the html 5 that offers to us the work place for doing all our cool gaming stuffs. To note is that it is a container to hold the graphics content and nothing more. Everything that needs to be done must be defined beforehand unlike the game engines like unity which have predefined objects like planes, spheres etc.Game ComponentsWe can draw rectangles, circles, lines using the 2D context of canvas object (in layman’s term - drawing in the canvas holder by using its 2 Dimensional object ).We can provide colors to fill, or use gradient colors, or even load images to make animations in the 2d context of canvas object.Reference Code in js-  var canvas=Document.createElement(&quot;canvas&quot;);document.appendChild(canvas);var context=canvas.getContext(&quot;2D&quot;);context.fillStyle=&quot;red&quot;;context.fillRect(10,20,30,40);This creates a color filled red rectangle in the canvas at (10,20) coordinates of 30px as width and 40px as height.GAME COMPONENTS AND THEIR MOVEMENTThe importance of these objects is that they can be moved inside the canvas by redrawing them to different positions, this being done per frame ! A separate function is created which helps in drawing the components taking the position as arguments that is called many times a second to update the position of the game components.The position can incremented each time adding a constant or a uniformly increasing function to make the component move uniformly or accelerate respectively.The movement is triggered also by adding event handlers through javascript, like “keydown”, “keyup” for keyboard keys, which then can be recognised using the keyCode attribute of the event argument of event -handler function call (see attached reference code).Reference Code in js-  window.addEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;, function (e) {        myGameArea.key = e.keyCode;        })//for calling a function callMe at 50 every milliseconds (or//better say 20 frames per second)//setInterval(callMe,50);Hence by knowing which key is pressed we can call the required functions for action to be taken.GAME OBSTACLES AND SCORELike other game components game obstacles are also game components but being generated at random coordinates of random shape, the code of which is much the same and i leave it to you :) .The score in most of the cases is decided by certain collision events or by the current frame from the beginning of the game.Its very easy to ascertain the collision between objects exploiting the again the boundary coordinates, and the current frame can be known by ensuring a  counter that is incremented for the function that is called per frame.I leave the job for you to google out the way to write text in canvas element to display the score when needed.ALMOST THERE !We  have known  everything to create our first simple html5 game with our own game arena and game components, game obstacles and score to compete !LONELY WITHOUT SOUNDS ?Well everyone loves the charm when there’s music in the air ! Luckily we can have it too in case of html5 “audio” object . Not going into much detail, we can add sound using the following sample code link, which i leave you to dissect.LINKS AND FURTHER READING  Adding sounds  Udacity course on html5 game dev  Udacity course on html5 canvas element  W3schools tutorial for html game",

Our aim was to design a navigation app which instead of showing top view of map shows directions on real time camera feed. This will have two fold benefits:  The users will not have to match roads and adjust map to understand where to go  Since it shows real time camera feed the user can remain in real world while looking for directions preventing accidents  Received the Best Programming Club Project during the Science &amp;amp; Technology Summer Camp 2016.Approach to inculcate AR in android appUnlike infrared sensors we didn’t have any means to calculate the exact distance of the real time objects in the mobiles so we switched to MATHEMATICS for our answers. OH! Technical Arts also played a key role in devising our strategy.  We used GPS data combiined with mobiles orientation from Magnetic Compass to detect roads. Here Google Directions API came in handy to give the precise coordinates of the roads.  We measured the relative motion of the user via gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS coordinates  The Unity graphics were relayed on the camera feed via UNITY GAME ENGINE giving the graphics (navigating arrows) a psuedo-acceleration to look static on the ground.References  https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-an-ar-android-app-with-vuforia-and-unity/  Android Documentation-App Demo video link: https://youtu.be/Cnm6HZRYHeg",

Here have a look at the killall commandExample (killing firefox) : killall -9 firefoxpkill commandAlmost the same as kilall command. The only difference being you don’t have to provide the exact process name, partial process name will do.Beware you might also kill other process which you didn’t intend to killExample (killing firefox) : pkill firef will also do ! :DThe xkill commandIf you are new to using LINUX or hate the bash, you may do it the GUI way :PSimply  type xkill in the terminal and it will ask you to select a window whose client you wish to kill.Fast if you have a GUI :PHave fun killing !!Fin",

      "content"  : "OpenCV is the most widely used Computer Vision Library out there. It isvery powerful and offers many features suiting the needs of anyone requiringImage Processing. This tutorial is a slightly modified version ofthiswith a simpler method of compiling.InstallationThe simplest possible install is always from the repositories.For Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:sudo apt-get install libopencv-devFor Other distros like Arch, you can find the respective commands on the internet.If you want python support too, you will need to install the python support by:sudo apt-get install python-opencvThe repository versions of OpenCV are usually not the latest versions and you might misssome features.If you need specific features or a newer version of OpenCV (let’s say for python3 support),you could look here for a very good guideon compiling OpenCV from source.Compiling and running Programs in C++Now that OpenCV has been installed, you might want to run a program to see if it is workingproperly. I would suggest the following program:#include &amp;lt;opencv2/opencv.hpp&amp;gt;using namespace cv;int main(int argc, char **argv) {  // A camera object  VideoCapture cam(0);  // An image object  Mat img;  while(true) {    // Storing a frame from camera to image    cam &amp;gt;&amp;gt; img;    // Do Your Operations Here    // Displaying image in a window named &quot;Image&quot;    imshow(&quot;Image&quot;,img);    // Waiting for a keypress for 5ms    /**      * WaitKey is very important.      * Even if you don&#39;t want a delay/keypress you should      * use it with minimum delay otherwise, the gui does not update      */    int c = waitKey(5);    // Quit on pressing q    if( c == &#39;q&#39; || c == &#39;Q&#39;)      break;  }  return 0;}This simple program just takes input from your webcam and displays it in a window.You can save it in a file named test.cpp.Now, in order to compile this program, execute this from the terminal:g++ -o Test /path/to/test.cpp `pkg-config --libs opencv`The parameter after -o, i.e., Test refers to the name of the executable created after compiling.After compilation finishes (hopefully without any errors), you can run this test program with:./TestFor a more involved and complex compilation involving cmake, you can lookhere andhere.Learning OpenCVNow that you can compile and execute OpenCV programs, you are ready to begin learning OpenCV.The OpenCV tutorials on their website is agood starting point. My suggested order of reading is:  Load and display an image  Adding Images  Basic Drawing  Followed by all tutorials in the Image Processing ModuleThe above order is because the initial tutorials tend to be more theoretical and focussing on the internals of OpenCVrather than actual usage.Plus, you might not need to see all the tutorials depending upon your needs.Best of Luck developing your OpenCV application.",

      "content"  : "AngularJS: Superheroic Javascript FrameworkFor all those who have worked with HTML and CSS, you know very well that HTML is great for declaring static documents. It doesn’t do so well for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. Angular lets us create expressive, readable, quick to develop dynamic web pages. AngularJS framework is written in Javascript. In this article, I’m going to be introducing you to very basic AngularJS, essentially talking about directives, expressions, controllers, data binding and filters.Prerequisites  Elementary knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Desire to develop responsive and dynamic web pages.Angular DirectivesLet us begin now. We’ll start with a website, albeit a simple one, that IITK’s alumni have made. The purpose of this website is for Y12 batch to stay in touch with batch mates and know the whereabouts of Y12 junta. A brilliant idea. We won’t be talking about the backend that is how the data is added and how the website fetches the data.Now if you right click anywhere on the site and chose inspect element, a small window opens in your browser. Find the body tag and you would find something like:&amp;lt;body ng-app=&#39;iitky12App&#39; ng-init=&#39;loadSettings()&#39; ng-controller=&#39;AppCtrl&#39; class=&#39;ng-scope&#39;&amp;gt;So what exactly is ng-app, ng-init and ng-controller?These are the angular directives. Directives are markers on a DOM (Document Object Model) element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS’s HTML compiler to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.Some common directives:  The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; element is the “owner” of an AngularJS application.  The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.  The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data. The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view.  The ng-repeat directive actually clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection. Consider this like a loop for HTML elements.Angular ExpressionsAngularJS binds data to HTML using Expressions.AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces:{{ expression }}If you remove the ng-app directive, HTML will display the expression as it is, without solving it.Two Way Data bindingData binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view. When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and when data in the view changes, the modelis updated as well. This happens immediately and automatically, which makes sure that the model and the view is updated at all times. ng-model directive mentioned earlier, is used for two way data binding.Angular ControllersAngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications. AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript Objects. AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers. The ng-controller directive defines the application controller. Like in the site mentioned in the beginning, in the body tag ng-controller=&#39;AppCtrl&#39; has been used. This means AppCtrl is defined as the application controller.Angular FiltersPerhaps again we should visit the site I mentioned earlier. Let us type CSE in the search bar ( :P ). Without taking any time, we get the results which have CSE linked to them. How does this happen?Angular Filters!! They give us the ability to format and filter the output according to our needs. So by using two way data binding we are able to use the search text entered and then filter the database using Angular Filters. We can also use filters to Order the results. Here is the link to the documentation.Supporting LinksSo I guess this is enough for a start. There is much to learn, but perhaps that would be covered in another article. I present to you a few useful links:  Coursera Course on AngularJS  Angular JS Website  W3Schools Tutorial on Angular",

R is a language evolved from the Language S (created by Bell Technologies)  I bet plotting graphs could never have been easier      It is the leading open source statistical and data analysis programming language,  as it handles and manipulates data too efficiently.    I personally recommend you to use R on UNIX machines . I haven’t tried it on Windows yet :P  Still not convinced ? Here is a list of things that R can do . Keep Counting !!Having Fun with R  install.packages(&quot;sudoku&quot;)library(sudoku)s &amp;lt;- readSudoku(&quot;c:/hard sudoku problem.txt&quot;)solveSudoku(s)Wondering what the above 4 lines of code can do ? Well It can solve the hardest Soduku Puzzle ever made ! Sounds Cool ?Google “Making a word cloud in R” and see how easy it is !Some Pre Requiste Knowledge  How to start R ?  Will their be an IDE where I can code ?The installation instructions for various platforms (including Non UNIX products) can be found hereAfter Installation. Just open your terminal and type RSome important things first  Whenever you are done with this language or simply wanna quit this Just type q()  Whenever you are struck anywhere just type help(commandname)  R is an expression language and is case sensitive      “R” &amp;amp; “r” are two different things    Whenever you type an expression, the value is calculated , printed and lost.  You better save the results of your expressions in a variable      An assignment also evaluates an expression and passes the value to a variable but the result is not automatically printed    Comments can be put anywhere starting with a Hashmark ( # )  Commands are separated either by a semi-colon ; or by a newline  If your command is incomplete R by default will give a + prompt and will continue to give a + prompt until your syntax is corrected.  NaN stands for Not a NumberProgramming in R FinallyAfter reading so much about R . It’s time to really start codingLoading commands in RIf you already have a .R extension file with certain commands already written , you can load it with the following syntaxsource(“nameofthefile&quot;.R)Wanna store all the outputs for a particular session ?sink (“nameoffile”)Simliar to a UNIX terminal you can type ls() to view all the objects you created in R for a particular session.  The collection of objects currently stored is called the workspaceHow to remove an object ?Use rm(objectname1,objectname2)Removing all objects  rm(list=ls())Try to understand this command on your own.It’s pretty easyData TypesUsed Python ?

      "content"  : "To begin with, I urge you to have a look at our Github repo for this website.Sure, Github serves the purpose of keeping our code public and accessible, and also lets users open issues and pull requests for the same.But more, we wanted to use Github as a medium to build the website automatically on commits to the master, and deploy the website as well.This would mean, anyone can write a post, or fix a file using Github’s online interface, send a pull request; which can be merged online as well. At no point was there a need to download the repository, and yet, the website would build in less than 2 minutes, and be updated for public. Isn’t this cool? Hang on for how this was done.Some basic informationA lesser known fact is that Github also allows you to host webpages.For instance, this website is also hosted on Github at pclubiitk.github.io/pclub.in.For this, you just need to keep your html files in a branch called gh-pages for a project repo, or in the master of a repo called username.github.io.This is itself a big topic to cover here.An even lesser known fact is that you can use Github to build your static webpages for you automatically, using Continous Integration (CI).This is only true for Jekyll though.The challengeOn deciding about setting up a CI for this website, I had several options in hand. But before that, we had several constraints as well. Some of them were:  The website uses custom gems. Github’s automatic page building would not build it.  We host this website on a server inside IIT Kanpur. That server is not directly visible to the outside world, and only the HTTPS port is forwarded. So an external CI cannot send its built files to the server directly.  Deploying a local CI seemed like an overkill. Plus, IIT Kanpur’s internally deployed Gitlab wasn’t fully ready to be able to handle builds etc yet.  Even if one could somehow build the files, it would not be a direct task to get the files inside IIT Kanpur.  Providing permission to an external CI to push to the repository would require committing the private key, which is insecure.The resolutionWe finally used Travis CI for this purpose. Travis is an online Continous Integration service, which offers to build your repositories for free, within some limits. You can customize how to build, and what else to do along with that much information. We set it up to build the code, and push it to the gh-pages branch of the same repo.Giving travis push access to the repositoryFor travis to be able to push to the repo, it needed to be provided a ‘deploy-key’, a key which provides access to a repository to the person having the private counterpart of that deploy key. I generated a SSH-key pair, and added the public key to Github on this repository. As for the private, it had to be inside the repository. But then anyone could copy it and pretend to be our CI. The way out was this. Turns out, Travis developers thought of this, and provided you ways to encrypt and decrypt files without storing the password anywhere. So finally, I ended up committing an encrypted version of the deploy-key, and then decrypting it inside the build machine during building. Have a look at that article to know how it can be done.Deploying to the branchThis was fairly easy. We make a folder named _site, and execute git init, git remote ... and git pull in that. We also checkout the gh-pages branch. This is followed by the build. So basically, the required files get updated inside the _site folder. We add all files to git, and commit. This is then pushed to the origin, and we have the up to date build files in the gh-pages branch.Getting the files inside the serverSince the pclub server is running blind to the world, there was no direct way for it to know that the repository has been updated. webhooks came to the rescue here. So Github has another gem, which lets you execute arbitrary actions on events. So first, I enabled PHP on the server which is serving this website, followed by a randomly named PHP script, which checks for a valid request, and pulls the updated repository from Git.Think of it as a way to tell the machine that the code has been updated online, and it should pull in the new code. So currently, on every commit, the server will pull in the updated website. This is very convenient, as you can imagine, and simplifies the task of maintaining the website considerably.Of note, the original version of this Gist was a major help in all this.",

It works primarilyin the normal mode and is aimed at more efficient coding and debugging.What it does is allow you to comment out a line in any file using thesame keybindings. Let’s say you want to have the shortcut to commentout a line as // because that is easy to type. Now for a block ofcode, you go to a particular line and press //, the line gets commented.You press // again, the line gets uncommented into the before state.This adds a very powerful tool to your workflow allowing you commentout as well as comment in lines very fast. You could also type somethinglike 5// to comment out 5 lines.This is what would happen:            Filetype      Before      After                  C      int a = 5;      //int a = 5;              Python      a = 5;      #a = 5;              .vimrc      set rnu      &quot;set rnu      InstallationFor vim-plug, add the following line to your .vimrc:  Plug &#39;scrooloose/nerdcommenter&#39;ConfigurationRead the README.md as well as :help commenter for a complete descriptionof features.

      "content"  : "Plugins!!Vim is a very simple text-based Text-Editor which can be transformed into a powerful IDE using plugins.This is the first of many posts I’ll write about vim plugins one at a time and how to set them up fully for a truly satisfyingexperience( custom tailored to your requirements ).The first step to using vim plugins is finding them. You can find a list of trending vim plugins at vimawesome.Once you find a plugin, you have to install it. Most plugins have a README.md which you should read carefully before deciding to use them.  Maybe it requires an external dependencyMaybe it needs a particular version of vimMaybe it requires NeoVimAfter deciding upon that, installation needs to be done via a plugin manager like Pathogen orVundle or Neobundle orVim-plug or dein …So now starting upon my theme of taking one plugin at a time and setting it up, let’s start with plugin managers. I’ll highlight installationof a single plugin in Vim-Plug, the one I use and just brush up on the other plugin managers. For an example, the plugin wewill be installing alongside the plugin manager is -NERDCommenter - It adds superb commenting powers in vimVim-Plug is relatively newer so most plugins don’t refer to its installation instructions. The example I have takenis generic enough to consider most cases. The steps remain the same for all plugins, only the link changes and someof the options I specified change.So now onto Vim-PlugVim-PlugA minimalist plugin manager and the one I use currently. Its features are highlighted at the top ofREADME.md.As per what I wrote previously, you really should check out the homepage, i.e, the README.mdand then decide whether this plugin is for you.InstallationThis involves a single file, plug.vim, which needs to be loaded when Vim starts and henceit is placed in ~/.vim/autoload  $ curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vimThe plugin is fetched using curl which is a command line utility for downloading content from the web.Now to install plugins, you need to add the relevant section in your .vimrc. For the example plugin:  call plug#begin(expand(&#39;~/.vim/bundle&#39;))&quot; Use single quotesPlug &#39;scrooloose/nerdcommenter&#39;......call plug#end()So let’s understand what I did here:  called plug#begin() ( a function ) with an argument specifying where to install the plugins. Indicates that all linesbelow this contain plugin options  Used Plug &#39;scrooloose/nerdcommenter&#39; to specify the plugin. Most plugins are distributed via github repositories nowadaysso &#39;scrooloose/nerdcommenter&#39; is a shorthand for https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter  called plug#end() to specify that no more plugins beyond this pointHere ~/.vim/bundle is where the plugins get installed. After adding this to your .vimrc, fire up vim and run:PlugInstall. This will start the installation in a side window with a nice progress bar while you can continue editing a filedue to the asynchronous install.To update plugins, run :PlugUpdateTo uninstall a plugin, remove it from your vimrc and run :PlugCleanTo update vim-plug itself, run :PlugUpgradeExtensive options are available for customising the experience. Many examples of installingare in the README.md with full documentation available by help.Also for learning how to use a plugin, once a plugin is fetched, you are encouraged to read its documentation using:help plugin_name, in this case :help commenter.Advantages:  Minimal and easy to use  Highly customisable plugin loading  Asynchronous install  On demand plugin loading and hence faster startup time for vimDisadvantages:  None that bother meDeinDein is the apparent successor of Neobundle both by the same person - Shougo.One of the main reasons why I liked dein is because it supports asynchronous installation/updating of plugins, something which Vundleor Pathogen do not support. Neobundle provides this with the help of another plugin (vimproc), but I believe inbuilt support is better.Advantages of using dein.vim:  Asynchronous Installs like vim-plug  Post installation hooks  Only Loads relevant plugins for a certain filetype and hence vim starts up fasterDisadvantages:  Relatively new and very little support  Help docs might be confusing sometimes due to too many featuresNeobundleSince dein.vim is the newer version as mentioned here,I’ll leave this out as deprecatedPathogenOne of the oldest plugin managers for vim and hence it is slightly involved.Pathogen works on the principle that most plugins are available from git repos,so any git folder in ~/.vim/bundle is a plugin and hence it needs to be addedto the runtimepath so that its data is loaded when vim fires up.So coming to the advantages:  Old and ancient and hence extensive support  Very clean vimrcDisadvantages:  Requires extensive effort from user side( some might consider this an advantage because you actuallylearn whats happening inside instead of an abstraction hiding it )  Help tags not generated automatically, need to update manually, need to uninstall manually, etc.  All plugins are loaded irrespective of filetype  Asynchronous installs only if you can type asynchronouslyVundleThe last but not the least, Vundle. Neobundle was a fork of thiswith more features and has now become dein. This is one of the firstplugin managers I used, thanks to Lakshay and kept for a long time till I decided to switchto Vim-Plug. This is very nice and easy to use but just a little outdated as compared to Vim-plug.The reason why I shifted from Vundle to VimPlug was because of its synchronous(blocking)install with no feedback on progress.Advantages:  Simple  Automated updation and helptags generationDisadvantages:  Blocking install  No post installation hooks  Loads all plugins irrespective of filetype. Slower vim startupA more custom-tailored installation using Vim-PlugThis portion is only for those who have some experience in vimIf you are a vim learner, you may skip it right nowtern-for-vim - It adds support for javascript in vim.tern_for_vim requires nodejs. (This is just an example, you don’t need to install this specifically)I am choosing this Plugin because it has a build step alongside the usual installation and is valid for only some file types.  call plug#begin(expand(&#39;~/.vim/bundle&#39;))&quot; Use single quotesPlug &#39;ternjs/tern_for_vim&#39;, {&#39;do&#39;: &#39;npm install&#39;, &#39;for&#39;: [&#39;javascript&#39;, &#39;foobarlang&#39;]}......call plug#end()What I did here:  called plug#begin() ( a function ) with an argument specifying where to install the plugins. Indicates that all linesbelow this contain plugin options  Used Plug &#39;ternjs/tern_for_vim&#39; to specify the plugin. Most plugins are distributed via github repositories nowadaysso &#39;ternjs/tern_for_vim&#39; is a shorthand for https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim  Now, if you read the README.md for tern_for_vim, it requires an additional step after installation, i.e., youneed to run npm install in its directory. Now, with other plugin managers, you will need to do this yourself butVim-plug offers the option to specify a post-install-hook i.e. the &#39;do&#39; which specifies what needs to be doneafter fetching the source.  I know that this plugin is useful only for javascript and foobarlang ( a super awesome language that can code the universe!! ).So I denote that this plugin should only be loaded &#39;for&#39; [&#39;javascript&#39;, &#39;foobarlang&#39;]. If I did not specify this, it would havebeen loaded for all filetypes, slowing down startup.Apart from the two non-default options above, there are many more. So how will you come to know about them???Read the help docs like I did at the github repo.Example of advanced usageVim-Plug takes the concept of loading plugins to another level by having an option to load plugins only when I call a certain function.For example let there be a plugin X which has a function Y. Now this plugin won’t be loaded at vim startup. Instead it will be loadedwhen I try to call the function Y. This plugin is valid for all filetypes but I only use it sometimes, so I set it up to only loadwhen the function is called.EndingIf you are a beginner in vim, I would suggest Vundle or Vim-Plug.Pathogen is too ancient and dein.vim is too complex. On a personal note,use vim plug as it has a simple interface for beginners and as and when yougrow more experienced, you can fine tune your plugins using it, as in the custom-tailoredexample above. Even the pclub cordis use vim-plug. See hereand herePSI consider myself a novice in vim with only 30-40% knowledge. So if my views seembiased towards Vundle or Vim-plug its because I used them. If there are any errors here,feel free to correct me in the comments.",

      "content"  : "Vim!Vim is one of the two widely known text-based Text Editor cum IDEs, the other one being, ahem, Emacs.For people new to Vim, it might have be a big leap, it is markedely different from the usual text editors, it being modal (implying that the same keys do differnt things in different modes. Don’t worry, modes are awesome.)This article has been taken from the blog at acehack.org. Please note that it assumes a bit of familiarity with Vim, and thus, you should first start off by reading about it, getting an installation of it, and learning how to type things in it (yes, you need to learn that too). It’s fun, I promise :smile:So, first, some cool things about Vim:      Firstly, you don’t have to press any keys beyond the Return key. No need to stretch/move your hands to press the home/end/page up/page down/left/right keys. There are much better ways to do that.        Then, Vim would work even on the most old computer you will ever encounter in your lifetime, and also on computers older than that. As a big boon, it works in an SSH session, and you are likely to find it (or Vi) on every PC you will ever need to SSH to.        Finally, Vim is yours to make. Everyone’s Vim is personalized, and is taken as a sign of identity. You make it whatever you want to; and yes, it can do whatever you want it to do (within sane limits).  BasicsOpen Vim by typing vim in your terminal, or else vim &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; to open a particular file. I also first recommend you to open vimtutor, Vim’s own tutor. I would be covering the basics pretty fast, as vimtutor explains them really well.So, Vim by default opens in the ‘normal’ mode. This mode doesn’t let you type text (so don’t freak out when you try to type something). In this mode, most of the alphabet keys are binded to regular text-editing functions. For starters, pressing ‘x’ deletes the character below the cursor.You press ‘i’ for Insert, this takes you to insert mode, where your alphabet keys work normally. Try typing something in Insert mode, then press the Escape key to exit to the Normal mode. Then move your cursor with the arrow keys (BAD practice, I’ll come to this) over some character, and press ‘x’ to see it get deleted.Now to embed the biggest change you should embrace, in Vim we use the keys ‘hjkl’ for moving. The arrow keys are NOT to be used. Here:  h: Left  j: Down  k: Up  l: RightGet used to these, and stop using arrow keys pronto. This is because, to be able to use Vim at the speed it is meant for, you ought not to move your hands away from the alphabet region of the keyboard. I’ll come to ‘banning’ the use of the arrow keys in a short while. Also, these 4 keys represent the 4 different motions in Vim (see section on Motions)So, learn the basic moves, you type in the Insert mode, you exit the insert mode for any editing. This is where you use the Vim specific commands. I’ll list the main ones here:      i: Insert mode        x: Delete character        yy: Yank a line (Yank implies keeping a line for pasting, like the concept of ‘Copy’ in modern text editors)        dd: Kill a line (Kill implies delete it, but keep it for pasting, like the concept of ‘Cut’ in modern text editors)        dw: Delete a word (from current position to the end of the current word)        p: Paste some previously killed text (y stands for Yanking)        gg: Go to the start of the document        G: Go to the end of the document        o: Insert a new line below the current line, move the cursor there, and then enter insert mode        O: Insert a new line above the current line, move the cursor there, and then enter insert mode        A: Enter insert mode at the end of the current line        0: Move to the start of the current line        $: Move to the end of the current line        %: Move to a matching brace (when your cursor is one brace, this moves you to the matching one, useful in languages like C where blocks of code are bounded by curly braces)        “+yy: Copy line which can be pasted anywhere other than Vim too (like Browser)        “+p: Paste text copied from outside Vim (Their meaning will be explained in a later section)  Now to saving files, you can save any text you write with :w. Note that pressing ‘:’ takes you to a special mode where you can type out commands. More on this later. ‘w’ stands for write. You can save a file you opened with :w, but if it was a new file, you would have to write something like :w filename to save it by that name in the current directory where Vim was opened.You can quit Vim with :q. Also, you can quit without saving changes by typing :q!Make sure that you check out vimtutor at this stage. Try practicing basic vim using that now.Repeating commandsIf you have to delete 10 consecutive lines, in a normal editor you can select them with your mouse and then delete it. Or maybe press Ctrl+Shift+Down and select them, then delete. All this is too slow.Here’s something better: 10dd. A simple and standard pattern for all commands in Vim. You can prefix them with a number to repeat them that number of times. So 10yy would copy/yank the next 10 lines.This is a very important thing in Vim. Similarly, you can copy 10 lines with 10yy. You can delete 10 characters with 10x. You can go 10 lines downward with 10j, or 10 lines up with 10k. You can copy 10 lines (such that they can be pasted elsewhere too) with 10”+yy. Try things out!MotionsI’ll explain this with an example. Type some C code in Vim, and don’t try to align it. Let it remain unindented. Now to indent code, in Vim you use the character ‘=’. Now, to inform Vim of the block of code you want to indent, say you have 10 lines to indent, you go to the 1st line you want to indent, then type 10=j. What does this mean?It defines a motion for Vim. It reads as ‘Indent the 10 lines below me.’ (remember j stands for going down). This might be intimidating at first, but happens to be really versatile with practice.What if you want to indent the whole code? Try this gg=G. This stands for ‘Go to the start, and indent all lines from the current position to the last line of the file’.Visual ModeAnother way to do stuff like this, which might be more familiar to new users, is the Visual Mode. You wish you could just drag and select a block of lines to copy? Here’s a way.Press Ctrl+V (this does not stand for paste in Vim, remember). This activates Visual Mode. Now you can move around with hjkl and see text getting selected. Leave this mode with Escape key.Now, say you want to copy 10 lines, go to the first line in normal mode. Press ‘0’ to get to the beginning of the current line. Enter Visual Mode. Press ‘$’ to select to the end of this line. Press j 10 times to go 10 lines down. See? You have 10 lines selected now (you can also use your mouse to do this, I’ll tell you how to enable mouse in a later section). Copy them with ‘y’, or if you want to paste them elsewhere, copy them with “+y.The colon commandsVim can do various other non-editing stuff with the colon-commands. You want to change your colour-scheme? Type :colorscheme &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; and you’re done (remember, Tab completion works here. Try experimenting with different schemes right now and choose one you like).Try typing :set  and then try Tab completion, you’ll see the various settings you can play with.\\nOf note, these commands stay active only till Vim is open. If you close it and re-open, these settings are gone. To keep them permanent, look at the section about the vimrc.Here is a simple setting: :set nu, this shows the line numbers on the left. Another thing (though not really recommended), you can enable mouse with :set mouse=a, where a stands for all. You can enable it for specific modes too, with n/i in place of a.The .vimrcSo, I claimed Vim is yours to build. Here is the way you do that. You use the configuration file called vimrc. This is a file located in your home folder by the name .vimrc. If not there, create a new one and open it.Here, you can set commands to be executed whenever your Vim starts (mind it, it can slow it down a very little bit sometimes, still faster than everything out there though). So say for example you want to display line numbers all the time. You can simply write set nu in your vimrc and save it. Next time you open Vim, it will have line numbers from the start.You can save Keymappings here, enable Plugins here, and do almost anything with your Vim here.PluginsThe best thing about Vim is, even though it doesn’t do everything itself, it can do almost anything with plugins written by the vast Vim community.Want Git support in Vim? git-gutter. Want auto-completion? AutoComplPop. Want to code in Scala? You have vim-scala.Here is how to set up your Vim to handle plugins fast and easy. You need a plugin for that too! :p Don’t get scared already. So, its called Vundle (vim-bundle I fancy). You can clone it with:git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vimThis clones the files required for Vundle to your .vim folder where your Vim files are stored (other than your vimrc of course).Now add this to the start of your .vimrc:  set nocompatiblefiletype offset rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vimcall vundle#begin()Plugin &#39;gmarik/vundle&#39;call vundle#end()filetype plugin indent onNow look up the plugin on GitHub (or other sources, I’ll update this thing). Say the homepage of that plugin is this: https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive (a very useful Git plugin).You can install it by adding this to your .vimrc: Plugin &#39;tpope/vim-fugitive&#39; after the gmarik line in the text I told you to paste above. Restart vim (close and open it). Now type in :PluginInstall (tab-completion works). There you go, Vundle will now download and install any new plugins you wanted to install.KeymappingsThis is one of the great features of Vim, you can map almost any activity you repeat to a key binding.So here’s a scenario, I use a plugin called NERDcommenter (I cannot live without this). This plugin by default comments the current line when you press leader ci . What I want instead is, to comment the line when I press ‘//’.So here is what I key-in: :map // &amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;ciThe :! stuffOne of the coolest things about Vim which modern editors cannot do, it to be able to run terminal commands right inside the editor. So say, you want to compile and run your C++ code from within Vim, and don’t want to exit, I’ll show you how to do that. Well modern editors can do this, but the fact that you can integrate these commands and actions into your keybindings, and plugins, and scripts etc etc, that makes this functionality a lot of fun.Try typing this: :!echo &quot;Yo hey! Vim is cool!&quot;. See? Now try :!date.I use this to compile my LaTeX documents on the fly: nmap &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; :w !pdflatex %&amp;lt;return&amp;gt;. A simple tap on F5, and the editor on the right refreshes the document preview. Neat, ain’t it?The possibilities with this are endless. You can write complete functions and scripts using this, to accomplish common tasks.I’ll add more info here as and when I get time.",

      "content"  : "Welcome to the Programming Club Summer Camp!This post will serve as a list of things you should and should not do while you get into coding.First off, coding is not this:Well, not to begin with, atleast. It’ll be plain, but we’ll get there in a while :smile:So you’ve done ESC101?Well, that’s a start. But ESC has focussed on the algorithmic, and syntax part of programming. Mostof the programs you’d have written would have been less than 200 lines of code (LOC). We’ll write thousands of lines together during the summers!It’s not as tough as you may think. Here we’ll focus mostly on design of applications. The code is not going to be as challenging as in ESC, but the design phase is going to be new. Structuring large applications is a very important thing to be comfortable with.Another requirement for most projects would be to use Linux and the Linux terminal. While the Game development ones, and the app development projects would be probably on Windows in all likeliness, we’d advise that you use Linux for all other projects.In addition, you’d also need to learn a very important tool called Git. Often people do not realize it’s importance till very late, and so, starting this year, all projects will be reviewed and hosted on a local Git.There’s another point which I would stress upon: The art of googling. Coming up on this soon.Now enough with the chit chat, we get to the real stuff now.We’re the Google generation!Quite literally; a programmer’s significant amount of time goes into googling away his/her troubles. This seems like a very abstract thing to say.  I know how to Google! I’ve been using it for ages!Well, here’s the deal. By Googling, I mean knowing the right keywords to search for, and knowing what all information is superflous in an article, which links are useless, which paras will not help me find the solution faster; these things.This comes by practice. If you cannot find a solution, Google more. You’ll be inproving this skill. Getting everything on a platter is not what coding is about, and you will need to dig deep to find ways to accomplish tasks.The art of gisting!Yes I coined a new word up there. The skill of absorbing information without having to spend 3 days trying to learn every single new thing; well I cannot stress enough on this skill’s importance.      You should have a clear aim in mind as to what you want to accomplish.        Follow it up with a basic reading of what all possible packages/technologies/softwares you can use for that.        Get hold of the basics of that technology. So if it is a web development framework, read the first 2 chapters of it’s documentation.        Set a small goal. For instance: I want a cool-looking top-bar for my website. Then read about how to do that (Google!). Do it, and keep seeing things which you do not know.        Keep setting newer targets, and the moment you come across something new, read a little on it; only as much as is needed for your target. And implement it.  This way, you would be churning out code after code, and it’ll be cool! You’ll not be mugging things, or reading long long articles. The majority of your time would be spent actually implementing things.So when people ask me how long it’ll take to learn Python, I say half an hour. Because that is the amount of time you would need to learn enough to start on a goal. Once you’re on a goal, you’ll be learning along the way. There’s no point spending days together on a thing for which you only need to know a little to implement.LinuxWell, Ubuntu would be great for 99% of Linux beginners out there, so go ahead and install it. Ask the coordinators for any help if needed. Go here -&amp;gt; UbuntuYou’d need to have an empty partition (disk drive) ready to be emptied completely, for this. If for some exceptional reasons, that is not manageable, try using VirtualBox.What is going to be the useful part is to learn how to use the Linux terminal. Once you have Ubuntu installed, try pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. You’d see a hacking-waala-box. That’s the terminal (Windows people know it as Command Line). The computer systems running today all run over such a thing. The graphics are mostly a farce, and a terminal is the one running things (Yes, really), and running the graphics as well. You can do everything you can do on a graphical system using this terminal (except of course the things requiring visual manipulation).So coming to the point, terminal is a really useful thing to know. Here’s an article you can follow up for this -&amp;gt; UsingTheTerminalGitAs mentioned before, Git is going to be invaluable. Git is a version control system, implying that it will manage your program’s versions; keep it organized, clean and presentable; let you go back to older versions; visualize your progress on the project; and many more things.To begin with, read some about Git and GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab (PLEASE note that Git and GitHub are very different). Start here -&amp;gt; Git Tutorial Atlassian. Go with the first few chapters.Git is an offline thing. It manages local versions of your code, so you do not have to keep folders like code-5-may, code-10-may and the likes. GitHub etc are online hosts for this. So if you want to work in a team on the same code, these websites will manage a centralized version of the code, and everyone can get copies of it and work together, and merge their work. Here’s something to help you understand the part GitHub does -&amp;gt; GitHub tutorialOh, and do go here for some hands on -&amp;gt; Git Tutorial. This is a pretty cool tutorial.A Good coding styleA seasoned programmer can judge a coder by his code style. Some things off the top of my head:      Do NOT write badly indented code. Most editors have an auto-indent feature. Make sure you indent your code all the time. Indent involves giving similar spaces to distinguish code blocks etc.        Fix an indent width. Most commonly used is 4 spaces. Set your tabstop to 4 spaces.        Fix whether to use tabs or spaces. Most editors will also have an option to convert all indent tabs to spaces. Do that to ensure uniformity.        Do not leave useless lines in between.        Use a fixed style of function definitions and curly braces. For instance, I prefer this one:    int main() {  // Code here}  Write ample comments. This is extremely important. But make sure you comment only at the useful places. Adding 2 numbers does not need a comment. Why you did that may need one.Keep in mind that a clean code is more likely to be finally deployed. Mentors will not want to look at bad codes and fix them if need be. So it is up to you to ensure that your code is good to look at.Text Editors!This may seem out of place here, but text editors are among the most important things on a programmer’s machine. Be sure to configure one properly. I’ll recommend atom, sublime for beginners. But if you want to reach the pinnacle of nerd-dom (No its not a bad thing, No it won’t stop you from having fun), I cannot recommend Vim/Emacs enough. Go and google Vim, please do. It’ll take weeks to configure properly, but it’s worth it.P.S. If you have some free time, also google for Editor Holy Wars and look at the Humor section there.Hacks in the codeBy hacks I mean tricks which are out-of-place, but work. These are temporary solutions, and are likely to break when you least expect them to. Try to stay away from them as much as possible. If not possible, put a comment starting with TODO mentioning you have to fix it.Also, placing code in random files is a hack too. For instance, for web development projects, you must not mix HTML/CSS/JS/PHP etc in the same file. Keep things logically separated. I made a sample website which demonstrates a good way of organizing your web code. Have a look at it once you’re done with learning the basics of web development. Here -&amp;gt; Webdev-basicsDone?We’re just scratching the surface yet! Get ready to code! Feel free to contact the coordinators for any help regarding these. You’ve got the spark, let’s get coding!",

      "content"  : "Handwriting Recognition using Machine LearningHandwriting recognition (or HWR[1]) is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. Machine Learning is incorporated to solve this interesting problem. Using neural networks and optimization the model learns the similarities of the training datasets which have a common result. Spell corrector is also incorporated to increase accuracy upto 97%.The program was developed on Lua using Torch libraries like image, nn, optim, etc to detect Handwritten text. Given image of a paragraph as input it can segment various lines and then further each line into individual alphabets including spaces and further recognize them. To increase the accuracy of the output, a spell corrector was incorporated in the program. Using a million words from Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle ’s novel and words from dictionary, a database was created, through which recognized words were compared by applying methods like Bayes’ Theorem the correct word was replaced.A database was made as a table in Torch using only images of alphabets android digits. In order to expand the database, letters were also rotated by +10 degrees and -10 degrees and added to the database hence constituting more than 10,000 training images. More than 500 images were also maintained as test images to check accuracyReceived the Special Mention during the Science &amp;amp; Technology Summer Camp 2016.Website: http://prathamv28.github.io/LaTeX Report: report.pdfGithub Wiki: Simulati-ON Wiki",
