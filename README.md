### Deployment

To run the theme locally,clone and navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server. Check `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` now.

I would recommend checking the [Official Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) page on Jekyll website.
